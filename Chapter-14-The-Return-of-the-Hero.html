Two laps? He is already at <gs id="5784c6f5-bf09-469e-a389-7b83e1ca504c" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="8deb36cc-3054-452f-922a-890e9ca874bf">ovet</gs> eight laps, and is beginning the ninth!</p> <p>Now there are dozens of people running behind Lingyun, rooting for him. Ning Lingyu, besting her beating heart, joins the people running.</p> <p>But on her face filled with emotion, her eyes full of tears, there is also an unmotivated sense of worrying.</p> <p>"Brother, stop it, you've done very well, you won the cheering and support of everybody, there is no need to keep on running, stop!"</p> <p>This is what comes out of her heart, hoping that Lingyun could feel it.</p> <p>Lingyun feels the energy in his body being consumed rapidly, he knows that if he ran for three more laps, then his energy would be definitively depleted, and then he would have to stop anyway.</p> <p>If he were to run after that, he might get injured.</p> <p>That type of training was common in the taoists farmlands, Lingyun doesn't understand why such a normal training could attract so many people.</p> <p>He wanted to be noticed, but this time he had clearly overdone.</p> <p>But his energy is not exhausted yet, he can't stop yet, otherwise he would not reach the goal for the day.</p> <p>After the ninth lap, beginning the tenth lap, Lingyun adjusts his breathing, and moves the bag of sand to the right shoulder (during the ninth lap, he kept it on his left shoulder). He is preparing for the final push.</p> <p>Among the cries full of surprise, Lingyun starts to accelerate and runs with all of his strength.</p> <p>Ten laps! Eleven laps!</p> <p>When Lingyun begins the twelfth lap, he feels that his energy is drained.</p> <p>He begins to decelerate, and after running for fifty meters more, he stops.</p> <p>Now everybody sets their eyes on Lingyun, waiting to see if Lingyun will fall or not, or even fall down deat.</p> <p>But what they see is that after Lingyun has stopped, not only he hasn't fallen, but he hasn't even thrown the bag away immediately.</p> <p>He stands still for a moment, with the sack on his back, in spite of the his legs and his whole body trembling, he just stays there with his back straight.</p> <p>This scene won't be forgotten by anyone.</p> <p>"Wow, he's really strong!"</p> <p>"Too good, too cool, even just at running he's soo cool, if I were thinner I would try and get engaged with him!" A little girl whispers.</p> <p>"Don't be silly, haven't you heard that Lingyun fancies that beautiful Cao Shanshan? Maybe he did all of this to catch her attention!"</p> <p>"Yes, I heard the same, and Cao Shanshan even made a bet on him!"</p> <p>On the sports field all kinds of rumors are now spreading.</p> <p>Tang Meng suddenly feels like he has been betrayed, and he wants to slam his head against a wall!</p> <p>He seems to have forgotten that he did not only the bet, but also the quotes.</p> <p>The thing that nobody believed could happen had happened!</p> <p>Driiing...</p> <p>The bell of the fourth hour rings some minutes later than it should have, all the students return to their classrooms, their faces filled with wonder and admiration, so much that they forget that they will be late for their lessons.</p> <p>"Tonight I will probably advance to the first level, and if I'm lucky, maybe even to the second!"</p> <p>After all the people have left the field, and Lingyun has normalized his breath, he then drops the sandbag and sits down on the floor.</p> <p>Despite the fatigue, his face is filled with joy.</p> <p>"Brother..." a timid but beautiful voice comes from behind him.</p> <p>Lingyun turns his head and sees Ning Lingyu, and is surprised!</p> <p>In the farmlands there were no really ugly women, but despite having seen seen so many beautiful women, Lingyun has to admit the beauty of Ning Lingyu.</p> <p>That face, thad body, that elegance. The girl named Lin Menghan from the past night didn't hold a candle to her.</p> <p>Okay, Lingyun admits that yesterday he mostly focused on Lin Menghan's legs and bosom, and he didn't really focus much on her face.</p> <p>"Hey, why is your nose bleeding?"</p> <p><a name="result_box"></a>Ning Lingyu suddenly sees all the blood pouring down the chin and onto Lingyun's chest, and she doesn't know what to do. She runs to him taking out her handkerchief, ignoring the smell of sweat and blood coming from Lingyun, and she cleans up his face.</p> <p>Lingyun is not listening to the words of Ning Lingyu, but as she gets closer, his eyes are filled with wonder!</p> <p>"Holy mother of god!"</p> <p>That body type was very rare in the farmlands as well, and if she dedicated to the farming, she could do wonders!</p> <p>Lingyun approaches the body of Ning Lingyu in disbelief, and sniffs loudly.</p> <p>He feels that a bit of energy enters his body, and he immediately feels better, recovering a bit.</p> <p>Ning Lingyu is focused on cleaning the blood on the face and body of his brother, and she doens't notice that. Then, she looks up.</p> <p>Lingyun's face is five centimeters above her head, and he is sniffing like a pervert.</p> <p>"Brother!" She feels embarrassed, even if he is her stepbrother, that's something too intimate.</p> <p>She thinks that Lingyun is smelling her body, and she blushes.</p> <p>Lingyun blushes as well, but he feels happy.</p> <p>He found a treasure! Haha, he's in good luck! His little sister not only treated him well, but she also had a special type body!</p> <p>Lingyun pulls back and with a serious expression asks, "Lingyu, what are you doing here, should you not be in class?"</p> <p>"I'll return to my lesson soon, it's fine."</p> <p>Lingyu dodges the question, and after she finishes cleaning his face she gets up and says, laughing: "You tell me that I have to go to class, when you yourself ...", meaning "you should be in your class as well", but not wanting to ruin the little self-esteem that Lingyun had just built, she spins it differently.</p> <p>"You made all this mess, how could I follow my lessons quietly?" she meant one specific thing: she was concerned.</p> <p>Looking at his sweet beautiful little sister, Lingyun laughs bitterly: "I wanted to keep a low profile, but I did not know that here people make such a fuss for something this small..."</p> <p>"And you call that keeping a low profile?" Lingyu laughs a lot, leaving Lingyun enchanted.</p> <p>"Brother, you kept a low profile until today, you were humble, with your feet on the ground, I do not know how you managed to resist!"</p> <p>Her brother today had surprised everyone, and he changed everybody's opinion of him. Ning Lingyu is really proud of him, she is happy!</p> <p>She lowers her head and looking at the bag his brother is sitting upon, she asks: "Brother, I have heard from others that this bag weighs fifty chilos, you carried it on your shoulders for more than 4,400 meters, many said that you could die!"</p> <p>"What? Die during a race is not my style!" Lingyun denies that unfounded theory.</p> <p>That sentence makes Lingyu laugh, and she thinks to herself that after six years her brother has become more talkative.</p> <p>She looks at her brother, and realizes he has some quality that she cannot well defin. Even though he is dripping in sweat, and he looks like he has just been pulled out of a river, she believes that now his brother has something special.</p> <p>It is something attractive and comforting.</p> <p>"Big brother, if you lost some weight and got into shape, would you still have those dimples on your face?" She thinks to herself.</p> <p>After some time of resting and absorbing the energy emanating from Lingyu's body, Lingyun's body is fresh and well once again.</p> <p>Suddenly he feels a grumbling in his belly, he's hungry.</p> <p>After such a race, it comes with no surprise!</p> <p>"Little sister," Lingyun, finally accepting wholeheartidly his little sister, says: "I'm going to put this bag away, I'll take a shower, and you go get ready as well, because later your big brother will take you to the restaurant!"</p> <p>"Really?" Lingyu is surprised, almost jumping in joy.</p> <p>"Of course it's true, lying is not my style..." Lingyun boasts while standing up.</p> <p>Lingyu laughs again. She realizes today she laughed more than during the whole semester. It was because her loving and caring big brother was back!</p> <p><strong>Note: If you want to support this translation, but canâ€™t donate, consider adding us to your ad blockerâ€™s whitelist.
