Some people were not enthusiastic about it, while others just loves it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One of the latter was entering my room right then.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &quot;You look on fire, prince.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Oh, I've done quite a bit for the sports festival today.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; I know that the prince was impatient to show to Iris what he could do. Because given his athleticism, unless he had an accident, he couldn't be defeated in the individual event.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &quot;Don't get injuried, don't get hurt.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Who do you think I am? Come on, look at me.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Perhaps he thought that Iris really cared about the individual event and would cheer him. I was smiling.&lt;br /&gt; I wished I were right, but I wasn't sure.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;By the way, Kurri, did you remember to invite the family of Iris?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Yes. We had to invite them because Iris is depressed, correct?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Yes. Tell my name when they ask for your invitation, later today at the festival.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Wait a minute!&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Don't you have a grudge with my father?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;He's still a noble, there is no problem.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; I was really surprised by the prince 's words.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Prince, have you invited me personally?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Oh, what is it? Is there something wrong?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;I thought I would be invited through the school. If I am to say your name as an invitation, I couldn't refuse even if I wanted to, and that troubles me.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Is that so?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br/&gt; This prince, I still didn't understand my power upon him.&lt;br /&gt; I mean, all of a sudden ordinary people were meddling with the prince, it was quite unsettling.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Huh, I should have taken care of that.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;I do not know who should have done what, but if Iris is pleased I'm ok with it, that's all.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; He was still not understanding.&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Well, Iris' family members will arrive soon, shall we pick them up?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Are you going to welcome them personally!? Do you want to kill them?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;What are you talking about? Do you mean to go greed them on your own?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Please, think about it, you might miss the beginning of the festival!&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;You're over-exaggerating, end of the story.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It was impossible to stop the prince, so we reached the entrance of the school.&lt;br /&gt; A coach arrived. It was supposed to carry Iris' family. I felt uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; While I was waiting with such a sense of uneasiness, I heard familiar voices calling my name.&lt;br /&gt; When I looked up, my parents were smiling in the coach.&lt;br /&gt; The looked much happier than I did.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Dad, mom, welcome.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Oh, you look fabulous, my daughter. And look at this wonderful banquet, let's have something to eat and have fun!&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Oh, no need to hurry, it's nothing special.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; My parents were only concerned about the food. I wonder if it is true, that travelling does that.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Hellan, it's been a long time.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; The prince stepped in between us. Oh, that development could bring nothing good.&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Oh, isn't this prince Ark. I am terribly sorry, we just had a long voyage.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;No, don't you worry. If you too would make me the honour of being your guest next summer, I will gladly come and visit your lands, Hellan.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Yes, absolutely.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; The prince bid them their pardon, and the coach with my parents left.&lt;br /&gt; My father looked pissed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It was because of the prince's manners. If you are not used to him, it's inevitable.&lt;br /&gt; We began feeling worried about Iris' family.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Huh, are you going to give up on waiting for them?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &quot;No, I won't!&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The tension was building up!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A few minutes later, a luxurious horse-drawn carriage approached the school.&lt;br /&gt; It had to be that one! Definitely!&lt;br /&gt; The prince looked relieved. The same feeling was manifested by my face.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I was wondering what Iris' family, who worked the field, could have been thinking while traveling in such a coach.&lt;br /&gt; It must have not felt comfortable to play the part of Cinderella.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The coach finally arrived, and the door opened.&lt;br /&gt; A woman with simple clothes came out. Her face resembled that of Iris. She was definitely Iris' mother.&lt;br /&gt; Even though she was about 40 years old, there was some kind hidden beauty somewhere in her appearance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Oh, this is such a beautiful place, I feel like I've entered a fairy tale.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Iris' mother was admiring the place with her mouth open. Then, a boy and a girl came out.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Even if I said “a boy”, he looked almost as old as us.&lt;br /&gt; He could have been as old as Rahsa, perhaps? I wondered if the tho girls were younger than him. He still somehow resembled them, anyway.&lt;br /&gt; They were both beautiful, just like Iris.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; They looked around, and seemed even more impressed than their mother. Their eyes were shining.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The prince was looking at that scene, and he felt immensely happy.&lt;br /&gt; I hoped he would wait for a while before speaking.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Welcome, I am Ark Kudan, and I am delighted to welcome the family of my friend Iris.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; The prince bowed with a fawless movement, paired with his flawless appearance.&lt;br /&gt; Iris' mother opened her mouth even more, incapable of cointaining her surprise.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Oh, did the prince himself... really invite us?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; She saw that elegant man, and figured out he himself was the prince.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Yes, of course, for my friend... milady!? Are you ok?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Before the prince could complete his sentence, Iris' mother fainted.&lt;br /&gt; She clearly didn't have the same iron will of her daughter.&lt;br /&gt; The unexpected presence of the prince was too much for her to bear.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Before she fell to the ground, Iris' younger brother caught her.&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Hey! I do not know what it means to be a prince, but you are putting too much stress on my mother!&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Her brother looked quite masculine.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The prince said nothing, and stood there looking quite shocked.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;I think we should bring her to the infirmary at once.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;I can carry her, shall you make way?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Yes, sure. Please, follow me.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The situation was still lingering, and the prince was still in a state of shock. He had made Iris' mother faint, and now her brother disliked him. There was nothing he could do.&lt;br /&gt; There must have been some way to make ammend. Surely.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He took Iris's mother on his shoulder and carried her to the infirmary.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; There were a lot of empty beds, so I just had her put down in the first one I noticed.&lt;br /&gt; Then I called a doctor and had him visit her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;It's just a temporary loss of consciousness.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Thank you.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; I thanked the doctor, and let Iris' mother sleeps in the bed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;My redhead comrade... or should I say “noblewoman”?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;No, redhead comrade will do.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Did the doctor ask for any money?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;No, the school will take care of that.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Well, that's nice. I got some gold coins before I came here, but I wanted to give them to my sister.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Unbelievable! Even a commoner was willing to give me gold coins!&lt;br /&gt; Prince, how come you just couldn't get yourself to do it, uh?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Anyway, Iris' brother was a good person. Of course he wanted to give that money to his sister, and not waste it over a stupid accident. I would have never accepted it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Hey, redhead comrade, this bed is soft, I've never seen one so comfortable.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;I think you should take advantage of the situation and rest for a while, don't you?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Is it okay?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Of course, I will take full responsibility, don't you worry.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Iris' brother smiled happily. Her sister, who was hiding behind her older brother, was also listening.&lt;br /&gt; The brother put a hand on her shoulder and whispered.&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Is it alright?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Of course.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; They laid down on a vacant bed.&lt;br /&gt; They couldn't hide their surprise when they sat.&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Oh my, it's so accomodating!&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;That's right, I feel like I'm being sucked in!&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Redhead comrade, you look strange, I'm sorry, I guess we are behaving unappropriately?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;No, I did the same the first time.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Redhead comrade.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; That time it was the sister, who pulled my sleeve and said.&lt;br /&gt; &quot;I am Asia. My mother is Clarissa.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Oh, I'm sorry, my sister always tells me to introduce myself, but I forgot. I'm Mikal. Thank you.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;The same could be said for me, I have been rude. I am Kururi, I'm in the same class of your sister, Iris.&lt;br /&gt; As soon as I said Iris' name, they became a lot more talkative.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &quot;Is our sister doing well?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;She is a good student, but it's tough here.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Does our sister eat properly?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;She always puts other people's priorities ahead of her own.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I saw they truly loved their sister.&lt;br /&gt; Uh, I had forgotten that the prince was still waiting for me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Don't you worry about anything, your older sister is much stronger than you think, and you will meet her soon.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; The two were really looking forward to seeing their sister.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Hey, would you call her here?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Pretty please!?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Wait here, and don't worry!&quot;&lt;br /&gt; I winked and immediately left the infirmary.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Well, how could I tell them Iris was not aware of their presence at the school?&lt;br /&gt; ... for the time being, I had to find the prince.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: If you want to support this translation, but can’t donate, Please click on Ad's&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;style&gt; .adboxes{ display: inline-block; height:260px; width: 49%; } @media (max-width:400px){ .adboxes{ display: block; height:260px; width: 100%; } } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;adboxes&quot;&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- buttom 1 --&gt; &lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; style=&quot;display:block;height:260px&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-5308237299920427&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;5485694392&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; &lt;script&gt;(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;adboxes&quot;&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- buttom 2 --&gt; &lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; style=&quot;display:block;height:260px&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-5308237299920427&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;6962427591&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; &lt;script&gt;(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;table style=&quot;border:none&quot;&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://novellatranslation.com/Blacksmith-v4-c2&quot;&gt;Previous chapter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;!--&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Next chapter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;--&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Otto</name></author><category term="Blacksmith"/><summary type="html">It was the day of the Autumn Sports Festival.

No, I didn't want to come closer, if possible.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;You are thinking about dirty stuff right now.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;No, absolutely not.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; He was trying to make his personality manifest. What a situation!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Iris seems to be moving.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Come, let's go follow her.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Iris' next destination was her usual farm.&lt;br /&gt; Her favorite vegetables were growing fast and good.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When she got there she always watered the field a lot.&lt;br /&gt; Any trace of sadness disappeared from her face, and she smiled.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;What is she growing?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Don't you see it?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Don't answer to a question with more questions. Just say what you are asked.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;It's vegetables.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Vegetables...&quot;&lt;br /&gt; It made no sense for the prince to be confused.&lt;br /&gt; The prince, who should have been knowledgeable, had no idea what vegetables were.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Aren't they too big?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Maybe it is the prince who has become smaller.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; he prince seemed very interested in that big vegetable.&lt;br /&gt; The nation is a prince's pride. He ought to strive ad create a rich country. And he should have returned with his feet back on the ground.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Who is helping her in the fields?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;It's a man named Toto. He just left the greenhouse.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; A guy coming out of the greenhouse was chatting with Iris.&lt;br /&gt; It had to be Toto.&lt;br /&gt; All seemed fine.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;result_box2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;Does he feel something for Iris?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Please, listen to them yourself.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; I knew that Toto was not in love with Iris, but the prince would not take me at my word.&lt;br /&gt; He was listening to them talk.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;I will get rid of him.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Stop!&quot;&lt;br /&gt; It was the second time that day I had to prevent a fight.&lt;br /&gt; Oh, come on! He was already leaning towards violence!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;No, they're just friends!&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Well, that's fine, then.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; He looked like a tyrant. In just one moment he could snap like that!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; While I was trying to hold the prince back, and those two were chatting happily, I noticed that Toto's complexion changed.&lt;br /&gt; A noise came from the doghouse we had made the day before.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Oh, Goru seemed to have woken up.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Goru jumped out of the doghouse and ran towards Iris at full speed.&lt;br /&gt; Along the way, he changed his target into Toto, and began chasing him with a threatening look.&lt;br /&gt; I think he was just jesting.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I absolutely loved that dog.&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Bad, bad boy, Alfredo, stop it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; After Iris spoke, the dog immediately calmed down.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Toto was about to die.&lt;br /&gt; Poor guy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Hey, since when do you have that dog?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;A couple of days.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Did you call him Alfredo?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;No, he's Goru.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Eh! But Iris just called him Alfredo!&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;result_box3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;It's Goru.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;... Goru?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; It was the second anniversary of the birth of the Goroist faction.&lt;br /&gt; It was a bit of a stretch, I know.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; While I was dissuading the prince, the aforementioned Goru now looked towards us.&lt;br /&gt; He clearly couldn't see us behind the bushed, but it was like he was aware of us.&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Did he smell us?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Was it really the case?&lt;br /&gt; Okay, was it time for the two stalkers to come out of the shadows?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; However, Goru soon lost interest and got distracted by something else.&lt;br /&gt; All the attention gathering on our hideout faded away.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Well, we're safe apparently.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;I won't do this again. I am literally sweating right now.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;I still don't understand.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Was Iris really depressed?&lt;br /&gt; Well, she looked absolutely fine.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When Iris left the field, she did not return to the dorm.&lt;br /&gt; The day was already dawning.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Even though it was dinner time, she left the school garden on her own.&lt;br /&gt; The sunset was gradually turning to red.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The prince blushed while looking at the horizon.&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Yeah, not bad.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Iris sat down in the field and pulled out some cheap paper from her pocket.&lt;br /&gt; Cheap making, the texture was also thin and rough.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Iris was staring at it.&lt;br /&gt; She was not just staring. Apparently there was something written on it. She read very carefully.&lt;br /&gt; Indeed, there lied our answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;result_box4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;Koibuma?! He gave it to her!?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;No, probably somebody in her family gave it to her.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Really?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Yeah, the nobles do not use such cheap paper.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Iris folded back the piece of paper.&lt;br /&gt; Perhaps she was thinking about her family, that she had not seen for more than six months.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It looked like the prince could be right.&lt;br /&gt; Iris was depressed after all. She was worried because of her family.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Now I see.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Does Iris want to see her family? But it's only three years, why does she worry so much?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Well, things are different for us, it's hard for you to walk in our shoes.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; I knew that feeling.&lt;br /&gt; Make the prince understand would be difficult.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Then you can help me understand.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;The winter holidays are coming, and Iris does not plan to return home. She thinks that if she studies more, she will have better chances of finding a good job.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;There will be more good opportunities in the future.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; The prince showed a huge grin as soon as he sad that. What was on his mind?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Oh, is it the Autumn Sports Festival?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Yes, the only opportunity for parents to visit the school will come soon.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;So Iris might have been thinking about her family all along, and we were not aware of it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;We were not until now. I will fix everything.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; I realized the prince was going to use his position to do something.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Iris' family are commoners, they they cannot participate.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;If they will be able to see their daughter, I'm sure they will be happy about it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; The prince looked really motivated.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Please do not tell this to anybody, especially the other people living with her. Think about the whole picture.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;How many gold coins would that be?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; We were talking about gold! Really!&lt;br /&gt; Things couldn't go any better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“20 would be enough, is it? Please keep it confidential”&lt;br/&gt; I got on the prince's proposal in the spirit of having money if I had it.&lt;br/&gt; it’s not a bad thing to wish that girl want to see her family&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you do not do too much, you should move in a good direction!

Two laps? He is already at &lt;gs id=&quot;5784c6f5-bf09-469e-a389-7b83e1ca504c&quot; ginger_software_uiphraseguid=&quot;8deb36cc-3054-452f-922a-890e9ca874bf&quot; &gt;ovet&lt;/gs&gt; eight laps, and is beginning the ninth!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now there are dozens of people running behind Lingyun, rooting for him. Ning Lingyu, besting her beating heart, joins the people running.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But on her face filled with emotion, her eyes full of tears, there is also an unmotivated sense of worrying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Brother, stop it, you've done very well, you won the cheering and support of everybody, there is no need to keep on running, stop!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is what comes out of her heart, hoping that Lingyun could feel it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyun feels the energy in his body being consumed rapidly, he knows that if he ran for three more laps, then his energy would be definitively depleted, and then he would have to stop anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If he were to run after that, he might get injured.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That type of training was common in the taoists farmlands, Lingyun doesn't understand why such a normal training could attract so many people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He wanted to be noticed, but this time he had clearly overdone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But his energy is not exhausted yet, he can't stop yet, otherwise he would not reach the goal for the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the ninth lap, beginning the tenth lap, Lingyun adjusts his breathing, and moves the bag of sand to the right shoulder (during the ninth lap, he kept it on his left shoulder). He is preparing for the final push.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the cries full of surprise, Lingyun starts to accelerate and runs with all of his strength.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ten laps! Eleven laps!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Lingyun begins the twelfth lap, he feels that his energy is drained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He begins to decelerate, and after running for fifty meters more, he stops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now everybody sets their eyes on Lingyun, waiting to see if Lingyun will fall or not, or even fall down deat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what they see is that after Lingyun has stopped, not only he hasn't fallen, but he hasn't even thrown the bag away immediately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He stands still for a moment, with the sack on his back, in spite of the his legs and his whole body trembling, he just stays there with his back straight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This scene won't be forgotten by anyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Wow, he's really strong!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Too good, too cool, even just at running he's soo cool, if I were thinner I would try and get engaged with him!&quot; A little girl whispers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Don't be silly, haven't you heard that Lingyun fancies that beautiful Cao Shanshan? Maybe he did all of this to catch her attention!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, I heard the same, and Cao Shanshan even made a bet on him!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the sports field all kinds of rumors are now spreading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tang Meng suddenly feels like he has been betrayed, and he wants to slam his head against a wall!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He seems to have forgotten that he did not only the bet, but also the quotes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thing that nobody believed could happen had happened!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Driiing...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bell of the fourth hour rings some minutes later than it should have, all the students return to their classrooms, their faces filled with wonder and admiration, so much that they forget that they will be late for their lessons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Tonight I will probably advance to the first level, and if I'm lucky, maybe even to the second!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After all the people have left the field, and Lingyun has normalized his breath, he then drops the sandbag and sits down on the floor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the fatigue, his face is filled with joy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Brother...&quot; a timid but beautiful voice comes from behind him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyun turns his head and sees Ning Lingyu, and is surprised!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the farmlands there were no really ugly women, but despite having seen seen so many beautiful women, Lingyun has to admit the beauty of Ning Lingyu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That face, thad body, that elegance. The girl named Lin Menghan from the past night didn't hold a candle to her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay, Lingyun admits that yesterday he mostly focused on Lin Menghan's legs and bosom, and he didn't really focus much on her face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey, why is your nose bleeding?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;result_box&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ning Lingyu suddenly sees all the blood pouring down the chin and onto Lingyun's chest, and she doesn't know what to do. She runs to him taking out her handkerchief, ignoring the smell of sweat and blood coming from Lingyun, and she cleans up his face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyun is not listening to the words of Ning Lingyu, but as she gets closer, his eyes are filled with wonder!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Holy mother of god!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That body type was very rare in the farmlands as well, and if she dedicated to the farming, she could do wonders!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyun approaches the body of Ning Lingyu in disbelief, and sniffs loudly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He feels that a bit of energy enters his body, and he immediately feels better, recovering a bit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ning Lingyu is focused on cleaning the blood on the face and body of his brother, and she doens't notice that. Then, she looks up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyun's face is five centimeters above her head, and he is sniffing like a pervert.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Brother!&quot; She feels embarrassed, even if he is her stepbrother, that's something too intimate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She thinks that Lingyun is smelling her body, and she blushes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyun blushes as well, but he feels happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He found a treasure! Haha, he's in good luck! His little sister not only treated him well, but she also had a special type body!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyun pulls back and with a serious expression asks, &quot;Lingyu, what are you doing here, should you not be in class?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I'll return to my lesson soon, it's fine.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyu dodges the question, and after she finishes cleaning his face she gets up and says, laughing: &quot;You tell me that I have to go to class, when you yourself ...&quot;, meaning &quot;you should be in your class as well&quot;, but not wanting to ruin the little self-esteem that Lingyun had just built, she spins it differently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;You made all this mess, how could I follow my lessons quietly?&quot; she meant one specific thing: she was concerned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking at his sweet beautiful little sister, Lingyun laughs bitterly: &quot;I wanted to keep a low profile, but I did not know that here people make such a fuss for something this small...&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;And you call that keeping a low profile?&quot; Lingyu laughs a lot, leaving Lingyun enchanted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Brother, you kept a low profile until today, you were humble, with your feet on the ground, I do not know how you managed to resist!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her brother today had surprised everyone, and he changed everybody's opinion of him. Ning Lingyu is really proud of him, she is happy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She lowers her head and looking at the bag his brother is sitting upon, she asks: &quot;Brother, I have heard from others that this bag weighs fifty chilos, you carried it on your shoulders for more than 4,400 meters, many said that you could die!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;What? Die during a race is not my style!&quot; Lingyun denies that unfounded theory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That sentence makes Lingyu laugh, and she thinks to herself that after six years her brother has become more talkative.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She looks at her brother, and realizes he has some quality that she cannot well defin. Even though he is dripping in sweat, and he looks like he has just been pulled out of a river, she believes that now his brother has something special.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is something attractive and comforting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Big brother, if you lost some weight and got into shape, would you still have those dimples on your face?&quot; She thinks to herself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After some time of resting and absorbing the energy emanating from Lingyu's body, Lingyun's body is fresh and well once again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suddenly he feels a grumbling in his belly, he's hungry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After such a race, it comes with no surprise!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Little sister,&quot; Lingyun, finally accepting wholeheartidly his little sister, says: &quot;I'm going to put this bag away, I'll take a shower, and you go get ready as well, because later your big brother will take you to the restaurant!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Really?&quot; Lingyu is surprised, almost jumping in joy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course it's true, lying is not my style...&quot; Lingyun boasts while standing up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyu laughs again. She realizes today she laughed more than during the whole semester. It was because her loving and caring big brother was back!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: If you want to support this translation, but can’t donate, consider adding us to your ad blocker’s whitelist.

And if he completed the fifth lap, Xie Yanjun would then lose!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But when, following with his eyes Lingying advancing, he sees Li Lei, looking much more imposing in comparison, Tang Meng's eyes burn with anger!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;It's all over!&quot; That is his first thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The proverb says that out of ten bets, nine are rigged. The small-time expert gambler Tang Meng is well aware of that, but today he has been surprised so many times by Lingyun, that he cannot think straight anymore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's why he didn't think that, was Xie Junyan to lose, he would certainly find some way to turn things around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And Li Lei is his Plan B!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Li Lei, don't you dare!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With this in mind, Tang Meng cries out and runs furiously towards the position of Li Lei.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But now it's too late, Lingyun has already arrived in front of Li Lei!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Li Lei first turns to look at Tang Meng who is rushing towards him, and he laughs with contempt; then he turns smiling toward Lingyun that is coming to him, and slowly raises his strong, muscular arm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Buddy, you're not tired? Get some rest!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Li Lei raises his arm and goes for Lingyun's shoulder while he's passing him by!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one thought that, at this stage, somebody would come and dare push Lingyun to the ground, so everyone is very surprised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;That person is really bad! Lingyun even spat blood, but he kept on running, and now this guy comes up to push him...&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Right, how could he do that? If Lingyun fell, he would get hurt pretty badly!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyun's sight is now clear, and his mind focused, so as soon as Li Lei smiled, he already knew that he had bad intentions, so he prepared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seeing that Li Lei actually wanted to push him, Lingyun laughed, and moving one foot in one second has passed by the arm of Li Lei, just moving to the side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I have always been the one pushing other people, being pushed myself is really not in my style!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;We'll settle this later!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a moment Lingyun is gone past Li Lei, and he even turns back and mocks him with a smile, as clearly realized by everyone!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Wow, he's fleet of foot!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Amazing, he spat blood, and he could still dodge that!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seeing the agility of Lingyun, all the girls in the playground admire him with bright eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Shit, how did he do that? He was about to be tackled! How is it possible?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tang Meng had closed his eyes when Li Lei had raised his arm, but when he opens them and sees that Lingyun is already a few meters away, his face is filled with amazement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Li Lei is even more amazed. He felt that his hand was about to touch the shoulder of Lingyun, how could he slip away?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Li Lei remains stunned for a moment, but despite the looks full of anger and the furious yells of the girls towards him, he pushes away a guy who stands beside him and begins chasing Lingyun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He is already compromised, so at this point he cannot allow Lingyun to complete the fifth lap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moving on with a steady pace and hearing the cries of the girls behind his back, Lingyun cannot know that this beefy boy is running after him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He speeds up a bit, tilts the sandbag slightly with his right hand, and conjures up his energies with the left hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Li Lei faces Lingyun once again, he wants to grapple him with both hands and throw him to the ground, that's what he is about to do!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He gets right behind Lingyun, and stretches his arms under his armpits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyun is waiting for that moment, he bends forward, swiftly lifts his left arm, grabs the bouncing sandbag with both hands, and by turning his torso he hurles the bag behind him!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyun is not holding himself back, he puts all of his strenght in this move.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pah! The bag hits Li Lei precisely on the shoulder, and as he was not anticipating that at all, he gets thrown to the groun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Li Lei's face impacts the ground, blood comes out from his nose, and he is not able to lift himself up anymore!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If it had been someone else, he would have already fainted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Wow, Lingyun is soo cool!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Good job! He asked for it!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyun did all of that in just one motion, without even stopping running.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bag drew a complete circle in the air and returned on Lingyun's right shoulder, who, after he threw Li Lei to the ground, took a deep breath and continued to run with the rhythm he had before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now Tang Meng has run to Li Lei and he begins to throw kicks at him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Fuck you, you wanted to ruin my bet, are you tired of living perhaps?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who is Tang Meng? The son of the vice president of the provincial police. He doesn't even care about Xie Junyan, so he cares even less about one of Xie Junyan's men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After kicking Li Lei as if he were a dead dog, Tang Meng is stopped by sp,e sports students, including Cheng Zhi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Tell me, who told you to do that? Why did you want to hurt Lingyun without a reason?&quot; Tang Meng speaks really bluntly, wanting to know the instigator of that action.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Brother Tang, you misunderstand me, I heard that last night that guy tried to rape Cao Shanshan, so ...&quot; Li Lei couldn't obviously say that Xie Junyan gave him the order, so he had come up with a random excuse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Raping my ass! Enough with your lies, somebody will certainly come and settle score with Lingyun about what happened last night, but that has nothing to do with you. Tell me, was it Xie Junyan, that bastard, who gave you that order?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tang Meng is really angry now, he is the only one in the school who can afford to call Xie Junyan a bastard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Brother Tang, you really misunderstand, really...&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although Li Lei is a really tough fighter, he has to pick who he is going to fight with, and he really doesn't feel like messing with Tang Meng, so he stays there on the ground, lying like a dead dog, just babbling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tang Meng spits in his face, and slowly says: &quot;Li Lei, do not put your trust in Xie Junyan's proection, you're not untouchable. I'm telling you, this doesn't end here! If you dare try and touch Lingyun again today, I will have you excluded from your final exams, am I understood?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Li Lei knows that Tang Meng is being serious, and knowing that when that bully said something he always put his money where his mouth was, he gets all pale and tries to explain himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Look! Lingyun completed the fifth lap!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;He's still running!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;This is supernatural! Supernatural…&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All those who were watching the scene turn around, because in the meantime Lingyun has already finished the fifth lap!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In that moment Tang Meng feels like a weight has been lifted from his chest, he gives a menacing stare to Li Lei, and then goes away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remembering how certain Cao Shanshan looked when she made that bet, Tang Meng shakes his head a bit. What a foresight that beatiful girl had!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hearing that Lingyun has completed the fifth lap, Li Lei pales, knowing he has definitively failed!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Xie Junyan will surely scold him severely, and he has even made enemy with Tang Meng. He deeply regrets getting in that situation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, he has forgotten about his greatest enemy, Lingyun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He is still not considering Lingyun of any importance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seeing that Lingyun managed to finish the lap even with that intervention, Ma Tianfeng is even more impressed. What kind of magical substance had been eating that guy, who ran even better after spitting blood?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sixth lap!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seventh lap!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the park the screams, applauses and shouts of support all mesh together and resonate in the sky. Everyone is going frazy for that guy that runs like a madman!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Lingyun is beginning to run the eighth lap, the bell ending the third hour rings!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All the students who were doing lessons were also attracted by the cries in the sports field, and once the bell has rung the come out immediately. Even if they do not know how many laps Lingyun did, they know that Lingyun is still running!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are not satisfied with talking about it in the corridors, they all come down to the playground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The students of the first and second year are the fastest, and they lead the crowd.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fastest among those of the third year, of course, are those from the VI class, that of Lingyun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After all the students have already left, Cao Shanshan packs her things in her backpack and stands up, her sinuous body naturally taking an S-shape, and with a smile on her face she sais to Zhang Ling that she can't wait to go downstairs: &quot;Let's go out to see what is going on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He seems in a very good mood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Se is very curious to find out if it was thanks to her that Lingyun became like that after a single night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But his change was huge indeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two girls leave the class but they don't head downstairs. Instead, they find a place with a nice view, and watch the playground while leaning on railings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Wow, how many people!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Utters Zhang Ling, while watching with amazement the multitude of people flowing quickly to the playground!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;He usually shows nothing of himself, but when he does, he sure surprises everyone ... this guy is still running!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Listening to Zhang Ling speaking with so much surprise, Cao Shanshan watches Lingyun running like crazy in the playground, and she gets lost in her thoughts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Shanshan, considering how long he's been running, how many laps do you think he completed?&quot; Zhang Ling suddenly begins to worry about Cao Shanshan's 1,000 yuans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I do not know if he took a break, but I think he has done at least four laps ...&quot; Cao Shanshan closes her rosy fist while looking at that silhouhette running on the track.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;He must have certainly rested, or he would be dead already, nobody could have so much energy!&quot; Zhang Ling smirked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this moment, the field is permeated with great enthusiasm, and some girl shouts:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Eight laps!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;What?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;What?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cao Shanshan and Zhang Ling are both completely astonished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;But is he still a human? Does he want to run to death?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zhang Ling's question is one many other people are asking as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She doesn't notice that Cao Shanshan, standing next to hes, has a strange light in her eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Only she, in the whole school, knows that Lingyun has managed to run nine laps because he has released the energy hidden inside him &lt;/p&gt; &lt;style&gt; .adboxes{ display: inline-block; height:260px; width: 49%; } @media (max-width:400px){ .adboxes{ display: block; height:260px; width: 100%; } } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;adboxes&quot;&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- buttom 1 --&gt; &lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; style=&quot;display:block;height:260px&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-5308237299920427&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;5485694392&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; &lt;script&gt;(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;adboxes&quot;&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- buttom 2 --&gt; &lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; style=&quot;display:block;height:260px&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-5308237299920427&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;6962427591&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; &lt;script&gt;(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;table style=&quot;border:none&quot;&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://novellatranslation.com/Chapter-12-A-True-Man!&quot;&gt;Previous chapter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://novellatranslation.com/Chapter-14-The-Return-of-the-Hero&quot;&gt;Next chapter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Otto</name></author><category term="Dragon Emperor, Martial God"/><summary type="html">Note: We are recruting Editor for our novels.

A man swiftly opened the window of my room from the outside, as I was trying to start with my daily manual labours.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Prince!?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; As I turned around and tried to catch up with what was going on, I looked clearly puzzled. I didn't care.&lt;br /&gt; In that moment I also realized that my room was exposed to enemy invasions at any time.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Well, well... I have a lot of things to do.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;What things to do? You are a prince, you don't have to do anything at all.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Sorry... You are just an artisan, you don't know anything about noble families.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Could you leave me alone, please?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Once you are done here, would you help me out?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The prince crouched down and caught sight with me.&lt;br /&gt; The atmosphere was surprisingly serious. For real.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;What is it?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;In reality, I was looking for Iris right now.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Oh, wow! I found a stalker. It was 9:31 am, and the prince was trying to get himself arrested.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;What, what are you doing?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; He grabbed my wrist and I shook off his hand.&lt;br /&gt; &quot;No, I am just kidding.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Well... Kururi, if you could help me out...&quot;&lt;br /&gt; I was busy, though.&lt;br /&gt; The prince assumed a more regal tone, and a new, selfish aspect of his personality transparred.&lt;br /&gt; Bothersome.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But cooperating with him would have a positive impact on my future.&lt;br /&gt; The prize was worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Ha, the unfaithful retinue will let the prince carry out his mission all on his own.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Why do you have to be so hostile?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Ho ho ho, I hit the nail on the head there.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Why was he looking for Iris? Whatever his motives were, I was worried.&lt;br /&gt; What could have been going on?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Iris was in the room next to this one a couple of minutes ago, so I thought we could go and have a look.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;No, you're being intrusive. Please stop it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;We don't have time.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;No, you never have time, do you.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I followed the prince, but I hoped that story would end shortly.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Iris is a very anxious person, don't forget that.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Bah! You do whatever you want! It's not like I care about Iris really!&quot;&lt;br /&gt; That sounded quite childish.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;What am I supposed to do exactly?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Don't just stand there, you have to escort me, escort me.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Escort? Is that my job?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Escort of the prince, a duty worthy of a noble. I guess I would do it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Recently, Iris has become quite worrysome, don't you think so?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;No.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Well, I'm not a woman, so I don't really know what is going on in her mind right now.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Iris has definitely been depressed recently, and if a friend of mine is sad, I feel like I have to do something about it... so we must find out what is going on, but we must not reveal ourselves.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;You said that we were going to do it right now, right? Where are we headed?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;... If something happens to Iris, I'll never forgive myself.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;You're forcing me to do this, remember that.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Feeling silent anger, our stalking continued.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;be/&gt; Today, Iris only took classes in the morning.&lt;br /&gt; I looked at her sitting in her class, she seemed focused.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; There seemed to be nothing wrong there.&lt;br /&gt; &quot;She's fine now, she's listening to the lesson.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;So this has nothing to do with it?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After the lesson, Iris walked into the library.&lt;br /&gt; Apparently, we were about to find something out very soon.&lt;br /&gt; We were peeping through the bookshelves.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;She seems ok, nothing looks wrong.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;We're wasting our time, we won't find out anything today... wait.&quot; Someone approached her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As the prince pointed at them, three mysterious beautiful girls were approaching Iris.&lt;br /&gt; They all had brown, long hair.&lt;br /&gt; They looked nice at a first glance, but there was something strange in the way they walked and moved their hands.&lt;br /&gt; Their skin was bright, and looked very neat. They had well-shaped hips, and were not excessively skinny.&lt;br /&gt; I didn't think anything good was about to happen. No, not at all.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The prince looked very worried.&lt;br /&gt; My face was pale.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It was because they were smiling. Not as friends, there was malice in their faces.&lt;br /&gt; It didn't look good!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Curse them! The prince was livid at those three girls!&lt;br /&gt; They were definitely about to harass Iris.&lt;br /&gt; I had never realized that before, but Iris was being harassed at school.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; They were doing it right there.&lt;br /&gt; The prince was about to jump out! Don't make anything stupid!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; They eventually reached her, but Iris didn't look worried. She was not really bothered by those petty things.&lt;br /&gt; I think she was much stronger than me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Oh, sorry.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; One of the girls hurriedly hit Iris' chair.&lt;br /&gt; Iris' pen slipped, and drew a long line on her book.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;I'm so sorry, can you forgive me?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Well, you didn't do it on purpose, there is no problem.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Iris answered with a smile. She showed confidence, and didn't look bothered by any of that.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The girls left.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; That event left huge scars.&lt;br /&gt; Not on Iris though. She went back to studying as if nothing had really happened.&lt;br /&gt; Iris was not the type of person to lose her temper over something like that.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Fortunately things had not escalated, and the incident had died out quickly.&lt;br /&gt; I was sure. Iris was not at all concerned.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In regards to the prince... ah, a storm was gathering.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The prince run after the three girls, who were walking away.&lt;br /&gt; Freeze!&lt;br /&gt; I hurried up and caught the prince's hand.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Let it go! Now you know what you wanted to, let it go!&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Not yet, I'm not done with those girls.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;It's not necessary!&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He kept on pulling until I could do nothing but let his hand go.&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Okay, then do whatever you want. But that won't help Iris in any way.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;... how can you say so?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;No, please, go and make a mess for nothing.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Ok, I won't do anything. But why is Iris feeling sad then?&lt;br /&gt; Somehow I looked a bit victorious.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Iris just doesn't mind it. She would rather have to work harder for her degree because she is discriminated as a commoner, so that everyone else will be impressed by her. That's how the world works.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Really?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Yes, she must face her own troubles so that the prince will appreciate her more, that's how she feels.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;... Ok, I think I understand. Their execution is suspended for now.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I saw Iris kept on studying.&lt;br /&gt; What was the hardest part of this job?&lt;br /&gt; It required a lt of endurance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; While Iris was eating in the school garden, we took the chance to have lunch ourselves.&lt;br /&gt; We both ate sandwiches.&lt;br /&gt; Mine had plenty of sauce.&lt;br /&gt; The prince had a vegetables sandwich. Raw vegetables, from what I could see.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Hey, I like that one as well.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Please, have a morsel.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; I let him do as he pleased. It is irresistible to be harassed by power.&lt;br /&gt; Iris ended her lunch and looked happy.&lt;br /&gt; There was nothing wrong at that moment, apparently.&lt;br /&gt; Still, the prince was mumbling.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Well, I had other plans in mind, but was the prince really going to follow Iris for 24 hours straight?&lt;br /&gt; It was about time we talked about something important.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Prince: why do you think people reward other people?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;There are several possible reasons. Maybe if you like a certain person, and that person feels happy for the reward, then you feel rewarded as well.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;What will I get for helping you?&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;We'll get this sorted out after Iris' issue will have been dealt with.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Well done, peasant. That seemed to work!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I had never owned anything of value.&lt;br /&gt; That was fine. Even if your house collapses, a merchant will still have precious items for sale, so they won't ever get lost. It was some kind of long-term investment.&lt;br /&gt; I really wanted something valuable though. This time I was actually expecting something in return.&lt;br /&gt; But in order to achieve that, we still had to fix Iris' issue.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Iris is going.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Okay, let's move.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Our suspicious stalking mission was not over yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Note: If you want to support this translation, but can’t donate, consider adding us to your ad blocker’s whitelist.

After a few seconds and even louder cheering burst out, mixed with a round of applause.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The fourth lap? Ah, that's quite slow...” Lingyun spouted with a hint of self-deprecation, while he was smiling and biting his tongue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pain! The pain! His eyes were now turning red.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the first lap, he had adapted to the weight of the sandbag.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the second lap, his acceleration had consumed his energy, and the sense of tiredness had diffused in his body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the third lap, tiredness had made a dent in his perseverance, almost prevailing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During those three laps, that took him more than 45 minutes, he had run for 1,200 meters!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the fourth lap beginning, all that remained to him was his will.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That sense of tiredness was a torture for ordinary people, but he was above that, and he trained to be the very best!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He would either run, or fall! And of course, he would run. With physical strength, energy and stamina depleted, he was banking on his very life force to keep on moving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Listen fat man, I don't care if you disagree, listen well! Since you started the fourth lap, you must finish it!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyun suddenly heard a sound similar to a thunder, while a tall figured appeared at his side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sweat was raining down Lingyun face onto his feet, his eyes still closed. He didn't dare to swipe away the sweat, afraid to break the running rhythm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, in hearing that voice Lingyun turned his head, and vaguely spotted an ugly smile to his left. He then looked forward once more, and kept up the pace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tang Meng was running beside him, trying to demoralize him. “Four laps? There's no way you will run four laps!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tang Meng then stopped in his track and stood still. He had seen a soaring smile on Lingyun's face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He's not doing that for the glory, or to impress someone. He's just challenging his limits!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cao Shanshan, you won.” Tang Meng looked ad Lingyun's back, far in the distance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point the students in the playground were not satisfied with applauding and cheering anymore. A girl run beside Lingyun. Then another, and another student began running beside him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Keep up! We're with you, come on!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Come on, come on!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;ouHighlight__4_5TO0_7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The cheering&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.01725647493921756&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.6821716296338095&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a name=&quot;ouHighlight__0_1TO16_25&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;playground&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.4790721183258322&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;ouHighlight__9_10TO27_32&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;became&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.44598142214064407&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.631692259538174&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;a unison.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyun was past half the lap when he reached Class 31. Xie Junyan's expression was now grimmer, as he looked at his girlfriend and was reading a message on his phone sent by Feng Wu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Boss, the fat pig is half way the fourth lap, what should I do?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Xie Junyan quickly answered the message.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He is almost done finishing the fourth lap. I don't care what happens, even if you have to break his legs, he must not do it!”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Xie Junyan gave her a vicious gaze, and then seemed to go back listening to the lesson as usually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back on the playground, Cheng Zhy was doing some boxing practice, put the phone back into his pocket, and looked at Lingyun running by.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His real name was Li Lei, and he was the brother of Xie Junyan, a true school thug. They went along after school, but in order to maintain his reputation, Xie Junyan usually had as little contact with Li as possible while in school. Xie Junyan had gambled big against Lingyun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Lingyun kept on running.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Only 100 meters left! Come on!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Come on! Come on!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Empowered by the cheering of more and more students from the lower grades, his steps got even faster than before. He was enjoying the sensation of the last energies left in his body and his spirit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Lingyun knew he had reached his very limit. His breath was getting heavier, and he began gasping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His throat was as hot as molten iron, and the burning sensation almost made it impossible for him to breathe. His sweat was no longer falling to the ground, it just evaporated, shrouding his body in a fog-like cloud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now he was still running thanks to inertia. He was still going, but his movements were no longer coherent, and he completely lost his rhythm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“After all, my body shows its limits!” Lingyun helplessly sighed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He knew that in order to complete the fourth lap, he had to deplete Reiki's seven chakras. He was reaching its limits, and the tiredness could make him fall to the ground at any time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The end of the fourth lap is close, I can still make it” Lingyun's gaze was wandering. Tang Meng shook his head slightly, his face betraying some regret. He looked at Lingyun getting closer and closer, and he didn't know why he didn't care about winning or losing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, when the fourth lap was almost completed, Lingyun's foot hit a small stone, and his whole body shook and seemed to fumble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People around him immediately screamed. Two low grade boys immediately run at Lingyun subconsciously trying to help him out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Don't touch him!” Tang Meng knew that, with just a little more strenght, Lingyun would not fall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyung completely let himself go. He would certainly not go back to school, but rather to the hospital. Lingyun spat out some blood. The girls running beside him suddenly hesitated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Vomiting blood...”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Running can lead you to vomiting blood... this...”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He didn't fall, he kept on running!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The fourth lap is almost complete!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In seeing the blood shining in the sun, Ma Tianfeng felt a punch to the stomach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Running until you spit blood, that's something that only happens during an international marathon, or a training of the special forces...” Ma Tianfeng muttered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a physical education teacher, he had felt the need to stop Lingyun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No, he's too tired, he's going to die, I can't watch this fool kill himself!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a physical education teacher is looking at his students running themselves to death, he has to do be responsible!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seeing Lingyun's blood flying, Tang Meng got so scared he almost fell sitting on the ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He's not good, is he? Is he still running?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone was wondering why he was still running. Even more, he now seemed more smooth in his movements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After spitting that blood, Lingyun's body aura seemed to awaken, rushing out from its hideout, forming a creek and flowing through Lingyun's veins!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It worked!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The body was now moved by the Reiki, Lingyun's spirit was shook, his eyes became clear once again, he was running much faster!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's a new-found strenght!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What? He's speeding up again!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Knowing he would lose, Tang Meng was looking at all of that with a distant, unknowing face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That's impossible!” Cheng Zhi witnessed the whole scene, which was contrary to common sense, eyes wide as those of a bull.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ma Tianfeng, standing idle, squinting once again, raised his arm and looked at his watch. “He's 9 minutes into the fourth lap, look how lively he is now. This guy...”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyun felt the energy the Reiki was giving his body, and smiled with his now bloody teeth. He felt much better now, and he casually raised his arm to wipe out the blood on his face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All he had to do was to run faster, an invisible aura surrounding his whole body, until that ran out!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Come on! Come on!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You're a true warrior!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everybody in the playground was running along Lingyun, and support cheers overwhelmed the campus. Some young girls were even crying for Lingyun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The finish line, I went there to block him!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After sending this message to Xie Junyan, Li Lei put the cellphone away and ran directly towards Lingyun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;style&gt; .adboxes{ display: inline-block; height:260px; width: 49%; } @media (max-width:400px){ .adboxes{ display: block; height:260px; width: 100%; } } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;adboxes&quot;&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- buttom 1 --&gt; &lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; style=&quot;display:block;height:260px&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-5308237299920427&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;5485694392&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; &lt;script&gt;(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;adboxes&quot;&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- buttom 2 --&gt; &lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; style=&quot;display:block;height:260px&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-5308237299920427&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;6962427591&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; &lt;script&gt;(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;table style=&quot;border:none&quot;&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://novellatranslation.com/Chapter-11-Change-Of-Perception&quot;&gt;Previous chapter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://novellatranslation.com/Chapter-13-Deafiting-Tiger&quot;&gt;Next chapter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Otto</name></author><category term="Dragon Emperor, Martial God"/><summary type="html">“The fourth lap!”, somebody exclaimed.

Thank you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is my name. I am a second grade student going to a special high school. &lt;p&gt;Even if it is special, it is not a place where people have cartoon-like abilities, or frequented by aliens. &lt;p&gt;It is rather a so-called idol training school... &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;p&gt;Famous school girl and boy idols go to the same school where I go. &lt;p&gt;But do I look anything like them? If you asked that, the answer would be “no”. Not even close. &lt;p&gt;Luckily, at least I'm not bald. But I'm pretty uggly, and I smell terribly. &lt;p&gt;Once I smelled so much, that I didn't dare to sit at my desk. Not even when the other students, and the teacher, invited me to. &lt;p&gt;I am such a celebrity that everyone knows me at school... in a bad way. &lt;p&gt;Moreover, I recently started to gain weight. I weighted 70kg when I arrived, but now I'm around 100kg. I think well of myself, but I can never live up to it. &lt;p&gt;I began getting fat after my parents passed away in an accident, and my happy days ended. It is the result of lacking parental guidance. Some say that a true person owns itself. Should I ask mom and dad for forgiveness? &lt;p&gt;As far as the looks are concerned, I can say that I have already given up, but it is my name that I really cannot stand. &lt;p&gt;No, Seiichi is cool as of sounds and letters, but my appearance isn't, so there is no point in changing my name. To the extent that you want to become a pedestal for the whole world to watch. I'm sorry. &lt;p&gt;Why am I like this? Well, if you go to a school like mine, it's obvious you get burned. It may not be an exaggeration to say that it is the center of the world. &lt;p&gt;So, why am I in this school? We are getting to it. &lt;p&gt;It is because the school is very close to my house, and because it is a school where you can enter even if your scores are not that good. Even ordinary people like me can go to this school as if it was normal. &lt;p&gt;Isn't it useless? Well, if you want to have a laugh it's funny! I am reflecting and regretting at the same time! &lt;p&gt;But really, I will admit that I hate myself, for convenience, but I don't care about the bullies. I would have been bullied even if I entered another high school. &lt;p&gt;There is a really profound reason why he has been doing such a long self-explanation. &lt;p&gt;This monologue is also necessary to keep his sanity. &lt;p&gt;So why are you doing this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It dates back to some time ago... &lt;p&gt;◆◇◆ &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey, pigeye! Go buy some bread!&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course, put that money to good use!&quot; &lt;p&gt;Gahahahaha Ha! &lt;p&gt;Along with these laughter, I was called names by several of the boys in the back of the gym, students during the lunch break, and I was there listening. &lt;p&gt;Well, well, there are truly amazing people at this school... There are also nation idols and somewhat famous persons. While me, I am nothing compared to them. &lt;p&gt;However, I can not deny that I behave like a good friend. &lt;p&gt;After all, I did go and buy bread to meet the boys' request, and even after that I was still being treated like a sandbag as everyday &lt;p&gt;stress relief. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Alright!&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Good!&quot; &lt;p&gt;The person confronting me punches me in the belly. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ha ha! Hoo!&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ha ha ha! It feels really good! I feel refreshing!&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, are you going to start the next lesson?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Would you like to go there again?&quot; Sure then, Pig! &quot; &lt;p&gt;The male students left the place while laughing. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Huh ... ...!&quot; &lt;p&gt;If I manage to stand up somehow while the pain abates, I will not fall to my knees and to the ground. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Haa ... ... huh ...... “ &lt;p&gt;Then somebody touched my face, and I expectied more pain. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey, Hiiragi!&quot; &lt;p&gt;A girl student came up to me. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you okay? &quot; &lt;p&gt;Brown hair falling on her shoulders. A headband on her head. Two big eyes, overwhelming and black. The lips were fresh and smelled of cherry. &lt;p&gt;The girl looking at my face anxiously was one of the most beautiful in this school. Next class's. &lt;p&gt;There are very few people who do not mind my body odor and would think about touching me. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Can you stand up?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, ah...&quot; &lt;p&gt;She went to me without any hesitation, so I think that this Hino girl is very kind-hearted. By the way, I am not so stupid to misjudge the situation and build up false expectations, just because she was a little kind with me. Telling me this makes me sad! &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hiiragi, what happened?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;... It's not like Hino cares, so I guess if you do not go to the classroom, you will be late for the next lesson?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh... yeah, that's right, but...&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Let's go quickly, but Hino would be better to move away from me. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Why?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Because someone else might misunderstand the situation, and I do not want to involve Hino.&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Huh?&quot; &lt;p&gt;As I said so, I ignored the pain in my body and began moving before Hino. &lt;p&gt;Hino seems to be really worried about me, but if you are so worried, you will get into troubles. Well, that's why Hino is a popular person, but I did not want such a nice gal to get involved, so I acted accordingly. &lt;p&gt;Thus, after the following classes, the lessons were over for everyone, and everyone was on their way back home. &lt;p&gt;Dling dlong – dling dlong. &lt;p&gt;Suddenly the broadcast rang. &lt;p&gt;&quot;To all the students of the school, please stop all actions and sit down.&quot; &lt;p&gt;Something was broadcasted, but I couldn't translate it in my language. &lt;p&gt;Everyone stopped for a moment, and while I was tilting my head, everyone else was sitting in great anticipation. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well!&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;What, my body...?!? &quot; &lt;p&gt;I remember that I was preparing for returning, but due to something invisible I was suddenly forced to sit down. &lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't understand what's happening...&quot; &lt;p&gt;I didn't get what was going on, so I tried to stand up again... &lt;p&gt;&quot;Wait, I can't move!&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;What is going on!? &quot; &lt;p&gt;I could not move as if I was tied to the chair. &lt;p&gt;No matter how much I tried to shake, I couldn't move a muscle. &lt;p&gt;It seemed as if everybody were really tied to their chair. &lt;p&gt;While everybody in all the classes were hesitant, the broadcast was played again. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hi, everyone. I am saying &quot;God&quot; in your world&quot; &lt;p&gt;A mysterious voice that didn't conform to any type of voice, of either young or old, came from the speaker. &lt;p&gt;&quot;You seem to be confused by the sudden situation, right? When cryptic things happen, humans can not keep calm. This is why human beings are pathetic and comical creatures.&quot; &lt;p&gt;I did not know exactly what he was saying. A human? Besides, the Lord of this voice called himself a god. &lt;p&gt;If you are seriously saying this under normal circumstances, you are probably already completely nuts. &lt;p&gt;However, we were now forced to sit down due to an unknown power, and we couldn't move at all, without anything really wrapping up our bodies. &lt;p&gt;That is why the strange authenticity in the word of God of this broadcast was building up in me. &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is complicated to explain every detail to people like you guys, so I will explain it briefly.&quot; &lt;p&gt;The voice coming from the speaker sounded somewhat amused. &lt;p&gt;&quot;From now on, you will go to a different world from this planet - another world&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&quot;&quot; &quot;... ...&quot; &quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of us began yelling suddenly. &lt;p&gt;And when someone regained their sanity, I opened my mouth to say something, but no words came out. &lt;p&gt;While everyone around me looked horrified, the voice spoke from the speaker again. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, by the way, even if it responds to my words one by one, it is only a little bit of May, so I temporarily deprived my vocal ability.&quot; &lt;p&gt;With that remark, I was definitively convinced that the Lord in the broadcast was «god», or a person speaking in its name. &lt;p&gt;Impossible. Such a thing cannot exist. &lt;p&gt;&quot;I will go back to my story, but first this is the reason why you to have you go to another world... the population of the Earth is increasing too much. You guys are just too lively. Because the Earth is screaming, it will be troubling if more people were to arrive. That's why I thought that a God like me would like to save the earth by sending you guys to another world right now.&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Am I not well-spirited? You know, I didn't even have to explain this to you, you could have just disappeared without feeling anything. I'm giving you the right to live by daringly transferring you to another world. I would like you to appreciate it.&quot; What on earth could be thas arrogant? &lt;p&gt;&quot;So, the world where you guys will go is the so-called fantasy world... If I said RPG, as in your games, would it make it easier to understand? I'll have you go there. Because it's a fantasy place, yes, there are demons, but you can also use magic. However, since things like science and technology do not exist, it would be really inconvenient for you, modern children, to go to a dangerous world. &quot; &lt;p&gt;Seriously? If it so dangerous, it would have been better to erase us all unexpectedly... &lt;p&gt;&quot;Because there are a lot of dangers in the world, there is no worry that people will increase at all, so I won't interfere there. There are no silly pranks from God, but it is also a world in which there is no such thing as a miracle. But there are things like level, skill, status, so maybe you just have to face it properly? The planet where you live is located higher than the world I am sending you now, so I think the status will also be more important than for the people here. Besides, I guarantee that you will not regret it. Your families who are on Earth have already had their memory erased. &quot; &lt;p&gt;Oh, in this case I'm so relieved we won't get to die sooner. &lt;p&gt;But don't you really regret having to erase our memory from our parents? Well, I don't have parents anymore anyway... &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, I'm also giving you the ability to check your status on the menu, an item box that can store as many items as you can remember, the language understanding ability to avoid trouble due to it being a different world, and a skill, as a little incentive. You might be able to move where somebody else is, but you will need some luck with that. It is important to think positively, isn't it? It's totally by chance that I'm sending you to this other world. I'm going to send any other group to different worlds than you. You guys and the school will be transferred as you are. Of course the building does not spread. Oh, yeah, you do. You also have skills and titles, but you will be able to check those from the menu screen.&quot; &lt;p&gt;What does all of that mean...? Moreover, all the people in the school? Our school has about 800 students in total. Isn't it quite a bit too many people? Anyhow, that world sounds different from ours, but it seems like people can be transferred directly to other people. &lt;p&gt;But... the skill you gave us as a gift is essential in this different world, is it not? If we have no language understanding abilities, there is no way for us to talk and be understood. &lt;p&gt;I do not quite understand skills and titles, but I am very grateful that there is a skill called appraisal. It seems to be usable for eating things you don't really know much about. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well then, I am done with this. I still have stuff to do elsewhere. Finally, I will give you about one hour to prepare yourselves. If you make a group, I will transfer it to a safe place. If you are lonely... I do not know where you will end up.&quot; &lt;p&gt;And with that, the broadcast suddenly ended. &lt;p&gt;And as I tried to move, I was able to lift from my chair. &lt;p&gt;But not everybody was moving yet. &lt;p&gt;People react very differently to strange events, and most people seem to be deeply disturbed by what they don't understand. But when I am in trouble, I try and keep my cool. &lt;p&gt;Because of that, everyone was still quiet. &lt;p&gt;Even though I became able to move, nobody else moved a finger. &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, one of my classmates other than me was beginning to act. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey, everyone! In the meantime, shall we consider the current situation?&quot; &lt;p&gt;Aoyama was not an idol, but a soccer club captain and an ace of the school. He was pretty good with girls. &lt;p&gt;&quot;First of all, let's find other people... if other people in the school will say that the broadcasting did happen, they will be transferred as well. Are the classroom doors open? What about the windows?&quot; &lt;p&gt;With thas said, me and the people close by to the doors and windows checked if they would open. &lt;p&gt;&quot;It's pointless, it won't budge. And the lock doesn't seem to be closed.&quot; &lt;p&gt;As they confirmed that one after the other, Aoyama nodded. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, then it is much more believable than the words of the broadcast were indeed saying the truth.&quot; &lt;p&gt;I put put my hands on my chin and began thinking. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Right, so if that broadcast said the truth, we should be able to check our status.&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Huh? Wait, wasn't that because we would go to a different world?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;It's just a theory, the teacher is in the staff room and it's better to keep things that you can check now... for the time being ... ... Status!&quot; &lt;p&gt;Although I meant to say that the broadcast was most likely to be believed, Aoyama took the words from my mouth and said so himself. Suddenly a translucent card appeared in front of Aoyama. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, here it is!&quot; &lt;p&gt;Aoyama quickly picks it and confirms it. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Guys... It is really a game like status, everyone please check!&quot; &lt;p&gt;So Aoyama said, and everyone displayed their status and began checking. &lt;p&gt;That was the situation. I was so very grateful that there was someone else who could handle the situation. &lt;p&gt;I also made sure that everyone had the status screen open, while trying to check mine. &lt;p&gt;«Hayato Hiagi» &lt;p&gt;Race: barely human; Sex: male; &lt;p&gt;Occupation: social garbage (unemployed); &lt;p&gt;age: 17; &lt;p&gt;Level: 1; &lt;p&gt;Magical power: 17; &lt;p&gt;Attack power: 1; &lt;p&gt;Defense power: 1; &lt;p&gt;Agility: 1; &lt;p&gt;Magic attack: 1; &lt;p&gt;Demonic defense: 1; &lt;p&gt;Luck: 0; &lt;p&gt;Charm: Unmeasurable (too low) &lt;p&gt;«Equipment» &lt;p&gt;Dirty student clothes. Dirty student trousers. Dirty underwear. Dirty pants. &lt;p&gt;«Skills» &lt;p&gt;Appraisal. ............ &lt;p&gt;This is bullying! &lt;p&gt;I am barely a human being ! I wonder if I'm too bad to be even human! &lt;p&gt;This Status sucks! It is impossible to measure if I am attractive! In a bad way! Besides, I have no luck at all! &lt;p&gt;Why is my equipment &quot;dirty&quot;!? Is my body so dirty? Should I cry!? This Status is just a bad mouth party! &lt;p&gt;“Social garbage” is not even a real profession! First things first, I'm a student, not an “unemployed”! This is ridiculous! &lt;p&gt;I can't stand it! What do you want me to do? Do you want me to die? &lt;p&gt;... Haa ... Huh ... &lt;p&gt;... It is too much ...! &lt;p&gt;While I was despairing for my status, I heard various voices all around me. &lt;p&gt;&quot;My occupation is swordsmen!&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I am a wise man?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;All statuses at 100, isn't it amazing?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, I am also 100.&quot; &lt;p&gt;... Seriously!? &lt;p&gt;Were they all starting out at 100!? 100 my ass! &lt;p&gt;I didn't want to have anything to do with them! &lt;p&gt;I was despairing over the difference between me and the people around me. &lt;p&gt;Why is a disparate society so cruel... But, I had no choice but to break my status. Although I did not want to share it with other people. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Okay, everyone seems to be able to confirm, so let's form a group next, it is already pretty late...&quot; &lt;p&gt;As Aoyama said so I checked the time, and realized that indeed 50 minutes had already passed since the broadcast. &lt;p&gt;&quot;There should not be any particular restrictions on the number of people making the group, or at least I didn't hear that during the broadcast. So maybe it would be less dangerous if “groups” became just one single group. I don't really know...&quot; &lt;p&gt;Aoyama started muttering. &lt;p&gt;Suddenly a translucent card appeared again in front of Aoyama. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh... I wish to register the names of the members of the group I would like to create.... OK! Well then, please tell me your names one by one!&quot; &lt;p&gt;After that remark, the classmates gathered steadily under Aoyama and registered their names. &lt;p&gt;If I also had registered along with everyone else, I would have definitely be the most expendable of the group once reached the other world. &lt;p&gt;So, I went where all my classmates were registering, to tell Aoyama. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey, register me as well!&quot; &lt;p&gt;However, I came back only with a cold line of sight. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Is there any problem?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Huh?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;What, do you have to put more tha one person in the group?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;No, no... it can also be... just one person...&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm fine with just one person, even if I will die some stupid death. Pigs always get close to me anyway.&quot; &lt;p&gt;I got a phrase. &lt;p&gt;No way... did bullying continue even under those circumstances? &lt;p&gt;I was surrounded by enemies. There was no one in this class who would talk to be normally. &lt;p&gt;Seriously, I am too twitchy that day... zero is not a figure! &lt;p&gt;When I thought of such a thing, one of my classmates stared at me, and then he began to laugh. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Cha ... ...! Gahaha ha ha! Jae, belly...!!&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey, what's wrong?&quot; &lt;p&gt;Other classmates also suddenly started to laugh all together. I looked at them confused. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, oh yeah...! Coins, is your status too much!? &lt;p&gt;&quot;!?&quot; &lt;p&gt;How, why did it happen? Nobody was supposed to see it! &lt;p&gt;How the hell did they read it... Then, Oki was laughing through the speaker. &lt;p&gt;&quot;I will tell you something nice. As I said on the previous broadcast, the status could be confirmed, so I tried using the&quot; appraisal &lt;p&gt;&quot;skill as a gift... then... Ahaba Cha-ho!&quot; &lt;p&gt;With an appraisal! Seriously!? &lt;p&gt;Following the words of Oki, everybody turned their heads towards me. &lt;p&gt;And--- &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ahahahahaha Ha!&quot; &lt;p&gt;Everyone laughed. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Jee... What's wrong with you!?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Why, all 1 ...!!&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm dead ... ... this is certain death...!&quot; &lt;p&gt;Far from being comprehensive, everyone looked like a child who had found an interesting toy in me. &lt;p&gt;&quot;With this you are completely at your feet! Who's going to put Temée into the group, baby!&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Wow... that's really bad...&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Social garbage ... ... It is a fitting occupation!&quot; &lt;p&gt;Everyone was making a fool of me, and I despised them. &lt;p&gt;I also tried using the &quot;skill of appraisal&quot; towards Kosori Aoyama, but the characters that appeared in my sight made me despair. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Because there is such a difference in the ability of the opponent, complete appraisal can not be done&quot; &lt;p&gt;After such words, the only thing I learned through appraisal was eventually the name of Aoyama. All the status columns got garbled, and I could not figure out what was written. &lt;p&gt;In other words, being at level 1 I seemed to have been totally abandoned bye everyone in my class. &lt;p&gt;There was nothing like me on the whole planet, I was inferior to other humans, and my ability level in a different world was fittingly as low as possible. &lt;p&gt;I put a blank in front of my eyes. &lt;p&gt;Seeing me in that state, the guys in the class doubled down on me. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Get lost, pests!&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I do not know why you are in this same classroom, why?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;If those abuses became a crime on Earth, but we went to a different world, wouldn't it still matter?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Seriously, will you die?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Dead.&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Dead.&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Dead.&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Dead.&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Dead.&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Dead.&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Dead&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Dead.&quot; &lt;p&gt;Dead dear, am I not!? In the meantime, the &quot;God&quot; is having a laugh! &lt;p&gt;What's this!? I'd like somebody to die for me! I didn't want to die, because I'm scared! &lt;p&gt;I was completely blown away. Somehow, I did not really care. &lt;p&gt;I did not have to be included in the group. Even if were, the torture would only last longer. &lt;p&gt;Let's think positive. Yes. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Wow... everything is blurring...&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I feel bad...&quot; &lt;p&gt;Eventually I did not get in the group, and one hour had passed. &lt;p&gt;Then, the broadcast started again. &lt;p&gt;Ding dong – ding dong. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Apparently a group has been made... There seems to be only one person left out.&quot; &lt;p&gt;Well, I am the only one who is alone!? &lt;p&gt;&quot;Even when fighting an insane struggle under such circumstances, human beings cannot grow up to face it. Well, I'm getting carried away now. You have to forgive me.&quot; &lt;p&gt;Oh, forgive? For what? &lt;p&gt;&quot;If you made a group, you intended to skip to a safe place to some extent. Apparently you will go to a certain region of the world, where a cerimony to summon brave people from other worlds is being held.&quot; &lt;p&gt;Eh, summoning the brave? &lt;p&gt;&quot;That's why all the groups in this school are being summoned to that country. I'll comply to that request. Well, just one person has been left out from that summoning.&quot; &lt;p&gt;Oops!! While you all are answering the summoning of brave people, I do not know where I'm ending up! &lt;p&gt;&quot;Anyway, things became a tad more dangerous due to the appearance of the demon king in your future world. So, I think you guys will be thrown into the fight soon. I don't think there will be much time to learn about the world through direct experience, so I put in your item box a book filled with informations about it. I can not interfere any further. This is my last act of kindness.&quot; &lt;p&gt;Seriously! That's one original concept of a God... &lt;p&gt;Besides, as a result of not being summoned as a brave man, I might skip fighting. It might be good to be alone after all... No, it is a lie. I am lonely, completely left out. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oops... it seems the summoning rituals has begun... &quot; &lt;p&gt;When the voice from the speaker voice said so, a magical light seemed to appear at the feet of all my classmates, except me. &lt;p&gt;&quot;You mind getting there immediately? I hope you will fight well. Good luck in the new world.&quot; &lt;p&gt;After that, my class members turned into light particles one after the other, and disappeared. &lt;p&gt;While watching every one of us disappear was ridiculous. I was really being left alone. &lt;p&gt;After a while, everybody had disappeared, as an aswer to the summoning of the brave. &lt;p&gt;&quot;... ....&quot; &lt;p&gt;...... So what about me!? &lt;p&gt;Even if I've not been summoned as a brave, I was supposed to go somewhere! &lt;p&gt;The voice from the speaker spoke noticing my impatience. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Haha. Calm down. You will be sent to the other side as well. But, as you are one person only, I cannot decide where to send you. I'll do this completely randomly.&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;What?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;In other words, you might be sent to a safe place, or you might be sent to a very dangerous place.&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Really!?&quot; &lt;p&gt;Gee... I'm a lucky guy, am I not? I think we have already been there... &lt;p&gt;Then, the voice of the speaker said something that made me chuckle. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well... It's a terrible thing to see that only one guy from the entire school has been left behind. Even all teachers, male and females, have summoned as brave men. So, I will give you one extra skill.&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Huh!?&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Let's see... Yeah, this will do. 【Complete demolition】... I will give this to you &quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Or, is it completely disassembled?&quot; &lt;p&gt;What is it? What a grandeous skill name .... &lt;p&gt;&quot;You will have an advantage, as you have a very high-tier skill, and this one can be used without risks. Well, in general skills are a convenient things that you can use without consuming anything, unlike magic that consumes magical power. Please check the effects after arriving in the new world. &quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, huh...&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oops. Apparently your transferring seems to have started.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah...&quot; &lt;p&gt;As my voice said that, my body was wrapped in light particles. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hehe. Well then, do your best in the new world!&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, I sure will!&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;May your fight well.&quot; &lt;p&gt;After hearing that, I completely disappeared from the earth. &lt;p&gt;And my adventure started from there ...! &lt;p&gt;... I'm sorry, it's all good. &lt;p&gt;◆◇◆ &lt;p&gt;At the school, where everyone had disappeared, a voice was heard from the broadcast. &lt;p&gt;&quot;People are really ugly, aren't they...? What were the seven cartinal sins from the Bible? Lust, greed, gluttony, sloth, wrath, envy, pride... I have not made any progress. That's why I'll get straight to the heart of the question in these cases.&quot; &lt;p&gt;The voice expressed no feelings. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Whose is the Earth?&quot; Is it a human thing? No, wrong. It is human beings that exist on our planet without permission. A vicious all-out battle is being fought for the land and resources of the Earth. It seems to have turned into a religious war. The Earth is such a nuisance, is it not? &quot; &lt;p&gt;So said the voice. But what it said next, it contained a grain of joy. &lt;p&gt;&quot;He has been denied so much, he always got the short end of the stick. I admire him. It seems that he was not even dominated by vengeance... Oh well, is it being realist, or is it giving up, to say that all is in vain?&quot; &lt;p&gt;And the voice laughed. &lt;p&gt;&quot;If a human being is truly open and logical, he was not a human to begin with. Oh, there are times when humans are so terrible, but I guess they are stil adorable.&quot; &lt;p&gt;The voice was full of kindness like a juicy mother. &lt;p&gt;&quot;From now on, I will watch over humans and guide them. I hope they will find happiness eventually.&quot; &lt;p&gt;The voice stopped speaking, and it would not do so ever again. &lt;p&gt;◆◇◆ &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, where am I? &lt;p&gt;I... Seiichi Hiiragi appeared in some forest he knew nothing about. &lt;p&gt;I would have at least liked to be near some city... &lt;p&gt;But let's check my the status! &lt;p&gt;---- Reach the source of the stream. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Ok, what about that?&quot; &lt;p&gt;Even talking on my own for the sake of my own sanity made me sound different! Quite impressive! &lt;p&gt;&quot;... for the time being, just move on.&quot; &lt;p&gt;After calming down, I decided to move from where I were. &lt;p&gt;Just staying there did not help anybody. &lt;p&gt;Looking around me again, those creepy woods grew thicker and thicker in every direction. &lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, I won't accomplish anything being here...&quot; &lt;p&gt;I began walking, while being slighly bent forward. &lt;p&gt;Without noticing, my words sounded nothing like I expected. &lt;p&gt;Hope You Like It!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Otto</name></author><summary type="html">It's Light Novel version of &quot;Shinka No Mi&quot;, So if you have any other Japanese novel For suggestion Please comment below.i will try to translate.

Anyone intrested please contact us @ Novellatranslation@gmail.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy Valentine's Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;How heavy is that bag?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tang Meng made his way to Cheng Zhi, where those three sports students were. He pulled out a box of Soviet cigarettes, picked one out of the box and threw it in his general direction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;p&gt;As long as schools would have games or sports, Tang Meng would do gambling with the athletes such as Cheng Zhi. So all students, no matter their class or sport, recognized them, and all were in good relationships with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cheng Zhi immediately recognized Tang Meng. Ma Tianfeng, the teacher responsible for their physical education, was holding a high school class, and was not paying attention to all of that. Cheng Zhi was smoking his cigarette, calmly blowing &lt;gs id=&quot;0b3f546a-2de1-461b-b0be-e2e361238630&quot; ginger_software_uiphraseguid=&quot;ac6de559-82c4-4dce-b645-6bd51a6dbac6&quot;&gt;out then&lt;/gs&gt; smoke, and then he answered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It's 50 pounds.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cheng Zhi is a practice runner, exercising to improve his lung capacity. So, smoking kind of defied the purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What? Such a heavy bag on this kid?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tang Meng reached the playground, and began looking at the people all around. He noticed this short guy, Lingyun, then said:“He began playing for fun, but that kid went overboard, and now he's down by 5,000.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Want to make a bet&lt;gs id=&quot;1572473a-168d-424d-892e-9efd950f813c&quot; ginger_software_uiphraseguid=&quot;19f691ff-e1ea-44c2-9125-cf0efcaae685&quot;&gt;？&lt;/gs&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tang Meng looked at Lingyun again, and then stared at Cheng Zhi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Tell me. If you carried a bag like mine, how long could you run if you really tried?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cheng Zhi looked very serious. Tang Meng, smiling, said: “Have you seen my body?

He was comfortable he could win &lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.024216975433326904&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;quite a lot on that bet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You know what, I think this kid can run for quite a long distance after all!”, said Cheng Zhi. They agreed on the best spot to start, where Lingyun went, and he silently prayed: he could not believe he was playing for such a gamble, when he was almost about to graduate!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Good luck on that lap!” Gasp!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;…………&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Pant... pant... pant...”. Running with the sandbag on him, his clothes were all wet, and his body was starting to hurt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As hard as he tried, Lingyun could not move any faster, and he was breathing heavily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He felt the pressure of the sandbag on his right shoulder, and every step felt like he was running on cotton, his knees stiff as a piece of lead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He began feeling very sour in all of his muscles, bones and blood, and running was getting harder and harder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His eyes were getting wet with sweat, but his willpower was as strong as ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That was an inhuman resolve! Like a real-life Starsky and Hutch, he went on relentlessly as if he had to catch some imaginary criminal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He knew that when his body became too tired, he entered that strange state, that allowed him to keep running on and on!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When he reached his uttermost limit, Lingyun resorted to the energy from the Meridians, powering every last muscle, and even his blood would leave his cells to wash his body, and keep him running.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;ouHighlight__0_3TO0_4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There is no doubt that&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.07372611743649193&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;ouHighlight__4_4TO23_24&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;he&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.8994635925384434&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;ouHighlight__5_5TO26_28&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;was&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.3300892057567131&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;ouHighlight__6_6TO30_34&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;tired&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.9359188090992364&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.6570255081219615&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;ouHighlight__9_9TO37_39&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;his&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.7276856635273579&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;ouHighlight__15_16TO41_44&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;eyes&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.5025883380453694&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;ouHighlight__10_11TO46_52&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;covered with&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.9966918243562168&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;ouHighlight__12_13TO59_63&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;sweat&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.9574561643884213&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;ouHighlight__21_21TO71_72&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;more and more&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.9563403238771152&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.8307773543793031&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;ouHighlight__28_28TO97_98&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.9653323351520477&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;He &lt;a name=&quot;ouHighlight__29_30TO100_108&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;struggled to&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.5751623281253717&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.9010123500627761&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;keep his back straight, but he was accelerating&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.3795015365539467&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He smiled, and enjoyed the sense of tiredness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What? He already run 400 meters, and he's accelerating?!”Tang Meng exlaimed, looking amazed. “Unbelievable... this guy...”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He thought to himself – even though he was the city long-distance running champion, if he had carried the same bag, he could have not run for 100, or even 50 meters!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that guy had completed a lap, running for more than 400 meters in total, and now he was even picking up speed!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He completed the standard 400 meters of the playground circuit, which he had run with a trembling step in 10 minutes. But now, even though he was tired to the extreme, he was gradually adapting to the weight of the sandbag, and even though he had a strange rhythm, it was like his body and the bag were becoming one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lingyun lacked supernatural powers, or even a proper running method, but he had a very strong spirit! He felt just a little bit tired now, but his soul was devoid of all fear. Why should he fear anything at that point?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;ouHighlight__2_3TO0_3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;His eyes shut because of the sweat, he was now laughing and smirking. He waved his right tight fist, the bag stuck between his neck and his shoulder, and began the second lap&lt;a name=&quot;noHighlight_0.27414490787034806&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Moving faster...”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was not using his full potential yet!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was not just between Tang Meng and Cheng Zhi at this point, everybody was looking at what was happening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Come on! Come on!” Somebody from the physical education students group cried, and then everybody was cheering Lingyun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He felt really proud of himself, and he gave no sign of slowing down!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Class 36's classrooms, Cao Shanshan heard all that cheering from the playground, and didn't know what to think. But she knew one thing: that boy was making quite an impressive run!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cao Shanshan smirked gently, putting up a Mona Lisa smile on her beautiful face. In three years, that was probably the only time she got distracted in class.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Class 31 the teacher was holding a lesson, but Ning Ling was not paying attention. His mind had flown to the playground, he wanted to stand up and run out right then, cheering for his brother along with those lower grade students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zhuang Meina heard those voices as well, and as she was not stupid, she realized that boy must had finished the first lap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He had almost finished the second lap, six or seven minutes later, and now the playground was crowded with people. He was certainly not done for yet!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zhuang Meina was almost disappearing among the crowd, and her amazed faced became hard to spot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seven minutes later, while the second lap was being finished, Lingyun began a third lap among the crowd's cheering cries. Although he began feeling dizzy, and his thoughts were getting confused, he mechanically kept moving his legs and go forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If I keep running at this pace, this sensation of dizziness will diffuse to the whole body!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When one is extremely tired, the body produces a sour sense of powerlessness, that really makes you feel like sleeping. But, through his immense spirit, Lingyun wanted to overcome that sensation. To train, it is really to train the mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The third lap! He is still up to speed, is this guy kidding me?! Where does he find such strength and endurance?” Tang Meng looked truly amazed, incapable of hiding his shock.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seven or eight minutes more had passed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His footsteps were as heavy as rocks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Pant... pant...” his breath getting heavier and heavier, he was at three fourth of the third lap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, his body was completely depleted of energy, and he was keeping on running by willpower alone. But he knew he could still run for a little longer, still trying to increase his speed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He's speeding up!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“His spirit is at the breaking point...” a lot of girls in the playground began to feel compassion for him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Come on, you can do it!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you just need to do one thing to change everybody's mind about you. Very few people knew Lingyun, and most of those who did were either indifferent or resentful towards him. But now, in that playground, everybody looked at him in a different way! Even those physical education and sports students, even Tang Meng and Cheng Zi. Even two physical education teachers, especially Ma Tianfeng!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This guy...” the tall and imposing Ma Tianfeng was thinking, looking at his crazy run. If he had seen such a scene two years before, or even just one, he would have certainly asked Lingyun to join the sports class!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tang Meng suddenly remembered about his bet with Cao Shanshan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Maybe Cao Shanshan really knows how to gamble. As long as he doesn't fall, this guy might indeed run four complete laps...”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: If you want to support this translation, but can’t donate, consider adding us to your ad blocker’s whitelist.

Obviously, we are more convinced of his judgment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;p&gt;Xie Junyan did not speak, but his eyes fell on the playground where Lingyun ran, careful observation of his pace, his movements, his breathing, and even his eyes, it looks like horse racing….&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With his observation, Xie Junyan brow wrinkled more and more tightly, his face has become extremely complex.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tang Meng saw him so he could not help sneer ridiculed: &quot;Xie big boy, you think this is a horse horse?

Even if he did not carry the sandbag he can’t run three laps on the Guards!&quot; Zhuangmei Na though know Xie Junyan certainly will not dig their own bet, but still Can not help but express his contempt!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tang Meng heard this is a big deal, but he could not help but twitching his eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the so-called small God of Gamblers, he set the odds of gambling before the natural setting, it’s not blind shouting, and he carefully observed Lingyun running posture and movement, for four laps, and happened to judge him!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for more than five laps ... ... That is purely insane, if not with specialized training, who can carry 50 kg of sandbags for two kilometers?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although this Xie Junyan pinch seven inches, Tang Meng quietly said: &quot;Xie,with four times the odds, won over 20,000, does it seems to you that this time to bet on Ben Lee? &quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Xie Junyan has long observed that the moment of the Tang Meng, he seems confident, fainted a chuckle: &quot;Come and do not be indecent also, last time you earned me a million, this time I get back 10,000, It 's just a draw ...

Hm?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hmph! You are so evil!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;You called this evil?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He placed his hand on her waist, slowly touching her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;What will you say if I am touching you like this?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Su Jian An's head was like exploded.

He wore a highly priced Piaget watch. That was the one that she bite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She let go his hand and acted like nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;You don't have to worry. I don't have interest on a little girl.&quot; Lu Bao Yan coldly glare to her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A, little, girl?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was probably an insult to her. She was angered: &quot;You are the little! I am 24 now!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lu Bao Yan glanced to her chest: &quot;The moment I touched you, it was like you are still 14.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Su Jian An didn't want to lose to him: &quot;You're like a four year old after I touched you!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh?

If you brave enough then why don't you just show it to me!?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She didn't even know what she said. She was looking to him slowly undressed himself. He was just put down his suit. Her face had gone really red like it was going to bleed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Lu Bao Yan!

Get out!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did he just toy her?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Su Jian An was even more angry than before: &quot;What gives you the owner of the room? You thought this is your hotel?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lu Bao Yan didn't say a thing. He was just looking to her. He was going to grabbed her hand and shoo her out but------&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Su Jian An quickly ran to the bed and lay on it. She smiled: &quot;Lu Bao Yan, you're the one that needed to get out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lu Bao Yan blinked his eyes and was still looking to her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Lu Bao Yan's phone that he put in the living room was ringing. That kind of ringtone meant that there is an urgent so he quickly went out of the room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Su Jian An let out her breath and she walked to the door.
