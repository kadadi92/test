Su Jian An couldn't stop staring into his sexy lips.</p> <p>"I don't have any feelings for you. Marrying you is to fulfill my mom's wish. You and I won't be the real husband and wife. Understand?"</p> <p>Su Jian An just blinked her eyes and said: "Um, yeah, this is a coincidence. I also don't have any feelings for you. Brother Bao Yam, can we shake a hand?"</p> <p>She still called him brother just like when she was tenth. After fourteen years, the word brother came out from her mouth won't get them any closer.</p> <p>Without looking into her eyes, Lu Bao Yan was like demanding his secretary: "Tomorrow you will move to my house and sleep in the guest room."</p> <p>"Are you afraid to sleep together with me?". She poked him: "Or are you afraid that you can't control yourself?"</p> <p>Her tone was full of provocation and her actions were funny. She had white skin and a small figure, eyes flashing like peach, she displayed an innocent appearance.</p> <p>Did an innocent looking young lady say that?</p> <p>Lu Bao Yan just laughed while Su Jian was looking into him.</p> <p>This one handsome felt like he let out some evil aura. </p> <p>Su &nbsp;Jian An slowly walked back.</p> <p>"Do you want to run?"</p> <p>Lu Bao Yan forced her into the wall. He opened both his arms and didn't let her escaped.</p> <p>Their face was so close until she could smell his perfume. Her heart was beating.</p> <p>"Uhm, brother Bao Yan, you don't have to stand so close to me. I know that you are still handsome like before~". She forced her smile and slowly squatted down to run.</p> <p>Lu Bao Yan grabbed her up: "Can you run when you are on Brother's watch? Hm?"</p> <p>Su Jian An was angry and said: "Let me go! If you don't, I will tell to Aunty Tang that you bully me!" Tang Yu Lan is the person that can threaten Lu Bao Yan.</p> <p>Lu Bao Yan just replied her calmly: "Do you mean that sleeping together and cannot control myself is a bullying to you? Hm?"</p> <p>"Hmph! You are so evil!"</p> <p>"You called this evil?"</p> <p>He placed his hand on her waist, slowly touching her.</p> <p>"What will you say if I am touching you like this?"</p> <p>Su Jian An's head was like exploded. This is her first time being so close with a man.</p> <p>Her face has gone red. She was panicked and staring him: "You're......"</p> <p>"I'm what?" Lu Bao Yan smiled and feeling kind of proud: "Do you still planning to tell my mom that I bully you like this?"</p> <p>"Rascal!" Su Jian An grabbed one of his arm and bite but there was something hard. He wore a highly priced Piaget watch. That was the one that she bite.</p> <p>She let go his hand and acted like nothing happened.</p> <p>"You don't have to worry. I don't have interest on a little girl." Lu Bao Yan coldly glare to her.</p> <p>A, little, girl?</p> <p>This was probably an insult to her. She was angered: "You are the little! I am 24 now!"</p> <p>Lu Bao Yan glanced to her chest: "The moment I touched you, it was like you are still 14."</p> <p>Su Jian An didn't want to lose to him: "You're like a four year old after I touched you!"</p> <p>"Oh? When did you touch me?"</p> <p>"......" Su Jian An didn't really touch him and now she is sweating so much.</p> <p>An evil smile was came out from his mouth, and said: "You forgot? It's alright. I let you touch me now." He grabbed her hand and pulled it towards his trouser pant......</p> <p>He even dared to do that!</p> <p>Su Jian An's mind had gone white and yelled at him: "Do you think letting me to touch you makes you a gentleman?? If you brave enough then why don't you just show it to me!?"</p> <p>She didn't even know what she said. She was looking to him slowly undressed himself. He was just put down his suit. Her face had gone really red like it was going to bleed.</p> <p>"Lu Bao Yan! You really are a rascal!" </p> <p>Lu Bao Yan coldly laughed: "You think I'm really going to show it to you? Get out!"</p> <p>Did he just toy her?</p> <p>Su Jian An was even more angry than before: "What gives you the owner of the room? You thought this is your hotel?"</p> <p>Lu Bao Yan didn't say a thing. He was just looking to her. He was going to grabbed her hand and shoo her out but------</p> <p>Su Jian An quickly ran to the bed and lay on it. She smiled: "Lu Bao Yan, you're the one that needed to get out."</p> <p>Lu Bao Yan blinked his eyes and was still looking to her.</p> <p>Fortunately, Lu Bao Yan's phone that he put in the living room was ringing. That kind of ringtone meant that there is an urgent so he quickly went out of the room.</p> <p>Su Jian An let out her breath and she walked to the door. She locked it and enjoyed her big room.</p> </div> <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script> <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;min-width:400px;max-width:970px;width:100%;height:90px" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5308237299920427" data-ad-slot="8439160794"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script> <hr> <style>.adbanner1{height:90px;width:100%}table.featuretable{border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:10px;-moz-border-radius:10px;padding:0}.featuretable td{text-align:center;border:0;width:50%}.featuretable td:first-child{border-right:1px solid #ddd}.dark-theme .featuretable{background:#333}#loadDisqusBtn{width:100%;height:50px;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;text-align:center;background-color:buttonface;color:buttontext}.dark-theme #loadDisqusBtn{background:#484848;color:#ddd}</style> <table class="featuretable"> <tr> <td> <form action="https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify" method="post" target="popupwindow" onsubmit="window.open('https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=novellatranslation/eMQl', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=550,height=520');return true"> <p>Enter your email address:</p> <p><input type="text" style="width:140px" name="email"/></p> <input type="hidden" value="novellatranslation/eMQl" name="uri"/> <input type="hidden" name="loc" value="en_US"/> <input type="submit" value="Subscribe"/> <p>Delivered by <a href="https://feedburner.google.com" target="_blank">FeedBurner</a></p> </form> </td> <td> <form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top"> <input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick"> <input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="DXC44X9QUP2XW"> <p> Donate to <b>"A Warm Wedding and A New Bride of Young Master Lu"</b> </p> <input type="image" src="https://kadadi92.github.io/testpublic/donate.png" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal â€“ The safer, easier way to pay online!"> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1"> </form> </td> </tr> </table> <hr> <button id="loadDisqusBtn" style="cursor:pointer">Show Comments</button> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <br><br><br> <script>$(document).ready(function(){$("#loadDisqusBtn").on("click",function(){var t="novellatranslation-com-2";$.ajax({type:"GET",url:"http://"+t+".disqus.com/embed.js",dataType:"script",cache:!0}),$(this).fadeOut()})});</script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> </body> </html>
