No, I didn't want to come closer, if possible.<br/> <br/> "You are thinking about dirty stuff right now."<br/> "No, absolutely not."<br/> He was trying to make his personality manifest. What a situation!<br/> <br/> "Iris seems to be moving."<br/> "Come, let's go follow her."<br/> <br/> <br/> Iris' next destination was her usual farm.<br/> Her favorite vegetables were growing fast and good.<br/> <br/> When she got there she always watered the field a lot.<br/> Any trace of sadness disappeared from her face, and she smiled.<br/> <br/> "What is she growing?"<br/> "Don't you see it?"<br/> "Don't answer to a question with more questions. Just say what you are asked."<br/> "It's vegetables."<br/> "Vegetables..."<br/> It made no sense for the prince to be confused.<br/> The prince, who should have been knowledgeable, had no idea what vegetables were.<br/> <br/> "Aren't they too big?"<br/> "Maybe it is the prince who has become smaller."<br/> he prince seemed very interested in that big vegetable.<br/> The nation is a prince's pride. He ought to strive ad create a rich country. And he should have returned with his feet back on the ground.<br/> <br/> "Who is helping her in the fields?"<br/> "It's a man named Toto. He just left the greenhouse."<br/> A guy coming out of the greenhouse was chatting with Iris.<br/> It had to be Toto.<br/> All seemed fine.<br/> <br/> <a name="result_box2"></a>"Does he feel something for Iris?"<br/> "Please, listen to them yourself."<br/> I knew that Toto was not in love with Iris, but the prince would not take me at my word.<br/> He was listening to them talk.<br/> <br/> "I will get rid of him."<br/> "Stop!"<br/> It was the second time that day I had to prevent a fight.<br/> Oh, come on! He was already leaning towards violence!<br/> <br/> "No, they're just friends!"<br/> "Well, that's fine, then."<br/> He looked like a tyrant. In just one moment he could snap like that!<br/> <br/> While I was trying to hold the prince back, and those two were chatting happily, I noticed that Toto's complexion changed.<br/> A noise came from the doghouse we had made the day before.<br/> <br/> Oh, Goru seemed to have woken up.<br/> <br/> Goru jumped out of the doghouse and ran towards Iris at full speed.<br/> Along the way, he changed his target into Toto, and began chasing him with a threatening look.<br/> I think he was just jesting.<br/> <br/> I absolutely loved that dog.<br/> "Bad, bad boy, Alfredo, stop it."<br/> After Iris spoke, the dog immediately calmed down.<br/> <br/> Toto was about to die.<br/> Poor guy.<br/> <br/> "Hey, since when do you have that dog?"<br/> "A couple of days."<br/> "Did you call him Alfredo?"<br/> "No, he's Goru."<br/> "Eh! But Iris just called him Alfredo!"<br/> <a name="result_box3"></a>"It's Goru."<br/> "... Goru?"<br/> It was the second anniversary of the birth of the Goroist faction.<br/> It was a bit of a stretch, I know.<br/> <br/> While I was dissuading the prince, the aforementioned Goru now looked towards us.<br/> He clearly couldn't see us behind the bushed, but it was like he was aware of us.<br/> "Did he smell us?"<br/> Was it really the case?<br/> Okay, was it time for the two stalkers to come out of the shadows?<br/> <br/> However, Goru soon lost interest and got distracted by something else.<br/> All the attention gathering on our hideout faded away.<br/> <br/> "Well, we're safe apparently."<br/> "I won't do this again. I am literally sweating right now."<br/> "I still don't understand."<br/> Was Iris really depressed?<br/> Well, she looked absolutely fine.<br/> <br/> When Iris left the field, she did not return to the dorm.<br/> The day was already dawning.<br/> <br/> Even though it was dinner time, she left the school garden on her own.<br/> The sunset was gradually turning to red.<br/> <br/> The prince blushed while looking at the horizon.<br/> "Yeah, not bad."<br/> <br/> Iris sat down in the field and pulled out some cheap paper from her pocket.<br/> Cheap making, the texture was also thin and rough.<br/> <br/> Iris was staring at it.<br/> She was not just staring. Apparently there was something written on it. She read very carefully.<br/> Indeed, there lied our answer.</p> <p><br/> <a name="result_box4"></a>"Koibuma?! He gave it to her!?"<br/> "No, probably somebody in her family gave it to her."<br/> "Really?"<br/> "Yeah, the nobles do not use such cheap paper."<br/> <br/> <br/> Iris folded back the piece of paper.<br/> Perhaps she was thinking about her family, that she had not seen for more than six months.<br/> <br/> It looked like the prince could be right.<br/> Iris was depressed after all. She was worried because of her family.<br/> <br/> "Now I see."<br/> "Does Iris want to see her family? But it's only three years, why does she worry so much?"<br/> "Well, things are different for us, it's hard for you to walk in our shoes."<br/> I knew that feeling.<br/> Make the prince understand would be difficult.<br/> <br/> "Then you can help me understand."<br/> "The winter holidays are coming, and Iris does not plan to return home. She thinks that if she studies more, she will have better chances of finding a good job."</p> <p>"There will be more good opportunities in the future."<br/> The prince showed a huge grin as soon as he sad that. What was on his mind?<br/> <br/> "Oh, is it the Autumn Sports Festival?"<br/> "Yes, the only opportunity for parents to visit the school will come soon."<br/> "So Iris might have been thinking about her family all along, and we were not aware of it."<br/> "We were not until now. I will fix everything."<br/> I realized the prince was going to use his position to do something.<br/> <br/> "Iris' family are commoners, they they cannot participate."<br/> "If they will be able to see their daughter, I'm sure they will be happy about it."<br/> The prince looked really motivated.<br/> <br/> "Please do not tell this to anybody, especially the other people living with her. Think about the whole picture."<br/> "How many gold coins would that be?"<br/> We were talking about gold! Really!<br/> Things couldn't go any better.</p> <p>“20 would be enough, is it? Please keep it confidential”<br/> I got on the prince's proposal in the spirit of having money if I had it.<br/> it’s not a bad thing to wish that girl want to see her family</p> <p>If you do not do too much, you should move in a good direction! I believed and took the devil's invitation.</p> <p>Thus the rite of the iris' family summoning was done.</p> <p><strong>Note: If you want to support this translation, but can’t donate, Please click on Ad's</strong></p> <style>.adboxes{display:inline-block;height:260px;width:49%}@media(max-width:400px){.adboxes{display:block;height:260px;width:100%}}</style> <div class="adboxes"> <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script> <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block;height:260px" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5308237299920427" data-ad-slot="5485694392"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script> </div> <div class="adboxes"> <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script> <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block;height:260px" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5308237299920427" data-ad-slot="6962427591"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script> </div> <table style="border:none"> <tr> <td style="text-align:left"> <a href="http://novellatranslation.com/Blacksmith-V4-C1">Previous chapter</a> </td> <td style="text-align:right"> <a href="http://novellatranslation.com/Blacksmith-v4-c3">Next chapter</a> </td> </tr> </table> </div> <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script> <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;min-width:400px;max-width:970px;width:100%;height:90px" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5308237299920427" data-ad-slot="8439160794"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script> <hr> <style>.adbanner1{height:90px;width:100%}table.featuretable{border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:10px;-moz-border-radius:10px;padding:0}.featuretable td{text-align:center;border:0;width:50%}.featuretable td:first-child{border-right:1px solid #ddd}.dark-theme .featuretable{background:#333}#loadDisqusBtn{width:100%;height:50px;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;text-align:center;background-color:buttonface;color:buttontext}.dark-theme #loadDisqusBtn{background:#484848;color:#ddd}</style> <table class="featuretable"> <tr> <td> <form action="https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify" method="post" target="popupwindow" onsubmit="window.open('https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=novellatranslation/eMQl', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=550,height=520');return true"> <p>Enter your email address:</p> <p><input type="text" style="width:140px" name="email"/></p> <input type="hidden" value="novellatranslation/eMQl" name="uri"/> <input type="hidden" name="loc" value="en_US"/> <input type="submit" value="Subscribe"/> <p>Delivered by <a href="https://feedburner.google.com" target="_blank">FeedBurner</a></p> </form> </td> <td> <form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top"> <input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick"> <input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="EVZ9HBHXCBNKE"> <p> Donate to <b>NovellaTranslation</b> </p> <input type="image" src="/public/donate.png" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal – The safer, easier way to pay online!"> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1"> </form> </td> </tr> </table> <hr> <button id="loadDisqusBtn" style="cursor:pointer">Show Comments</button> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <br><br><br> <script>$(document).ready(function(){$("#loadDisqusBtn").on("click",function(){var t="novellatranslation-com-2";$.ajax({type:"GET",url:"http://"+t+".disqus.com/embed.js",dataType:"script",cache:!0}),$(this).fadeOut()})});</script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> </body> </html>
