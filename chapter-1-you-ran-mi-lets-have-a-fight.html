Let's have a fight!"</p> <p>There's a woman, the most charming woman, a young woman with a gentle and weak appearance, confronting a man with a strong-build body. </p> <p>"I'm begging you, stop hitting me, miss Luo, sister...... I understand it, please stop, I'm begging you......"</p> <p>You Ran-Mi scampered off like a frightened rat, the young woman keeps swinging her long sleeves, crackling sounds to be heard, hitting You Ran-Mi until he begs for a mercy, at the moment, a loud eerie screaming of waaa waaa, suddenly the young woman started to dread.</p> <p>"Poor child don't cry, mother is right beside you!" At the same, she just flashed into the floating cradle's side.</p> <p>You Ran-Mi with a painful face, this old woman is such an unreasonable woman! He followed the woman, his eyes gleaming with a flashing radiance of motherly love.</p> <p>"Baby, don't cry, father is here! " Mei-Luo hugged the baby into her arms, growling fiercely toward You Ran-Mi: "Get lost! You still think that you are a father of our child?! You even thinking of abandon our child, I......"</p> <p>Without giving her mother the moment to floating down to the earth, the baby cried out aloud. </p> <p>"Child don't cry, father does not love you, but mother does!" Mei-Luo displayed a face of motherly love, holding the baby and swaying softly.</p> <p>You Ran-Mi showed a bitter face.</p> <p>"My wife, we had offended a lot of high masters, the world has an uncountable of killers, and we even offended to the master of the world, if it's just the two of us, we can still beat them, but if our child is coming with us......"</p> <p>Mei-Luo knew that her husband was the master of the Eight Diagrams, high intelligence, also the master of handling a crowd fight, highly accurate in analyzing his enemies, although he was not the most intelligent man in the world, but still unbeatable.</p> <p>However, at the current situation, the woman will not abandon her child.</p> <p>"I am the Mahayana Taoist, who dares to reach their hand, I will destroy their entire family!"</p> <p>Feeling anxious of You Ran-Mi, he cannot hold it in and growled: "Destroying their entire family is easy, but if the baby is with us, the baby could have died!" Mei-Luo carried the baby with an arm and runs, long sleeves of hers swinging along the way. </p> <p>You Ran-Mi did not hide, her long sleeves slapped onto his face, which made him staggered and thrown away! This time Mei-Luo expressed a heartaching face.</p> <p>"Foolish, can't you even hide?"</p> <p>"I am alright, hold your fire down, let me explain, please?" said the bitterly You Ran-Mi.</p> <p>"No! No! I will not listen to you!"</p> <p>You Ran-Mi howled in sudden: "If you are like that, they will kill our child!"</p> <p>Hearing these words from her husband, Mei-Luo calmed down, her tears dropped from her eyes. </p> <p>Even if she is the Mahayana Taoist or any kind of master, she is still an ordinary person, a mother of her child.</p> <p>This time You Ran-Mi panicked, he flew towards his wife and embrace her.</p> <p>"Luo, my wife, do not cry, please! Do not worry, I will find out the best way for us, I will find a way for our child grow up without anything to worry about."</p> <p>"But I want to raise my child......"</p> <p>She gently took a look at the baby and burst into tears.</p> <p>You Ran-Mi tried to overcome his depression, he acknowledged it, he cannot let himself in panic, he must convince his wife.</p> <p>"I love my child...... but for the sake of our child, we have stolen the treasures of many clans, we must committed our sins. If it was only the two of us, I will not afraid of them, but our child, we cannot protect him, he is so fragile, he is too small!"</p> <p>With a teary eyes, Mei-Luo stared into her baby.</p> <p>"My husband, is there any solutions? How is it so we can protect our beloved baby?"</p> <p>You Ran-Mi let out a sigh, hearing his wife called out my husband these two words, meaning that his wife had come to her senses.</p> <p>Mei-Luo and You Ran-Mi are the famous partner in the Tao world, together they had come across the Tao world with years of training.</p> <p>However, Mei-Luo trained herself until the great Mahayana, she did not know why but she wanted a baby that time, but reached the Mahayana realm, carrying a baby is an extremely difficult thing to do, because of this, the husband and wife searching for treasures, obtained the magical power of the treasures, produced their offspring.</p> <p>After hundred years of searching treasures, stole too much treasures from the clans all over the world, Mei-Luo still has not pregnant, till they stole the treasure of Yan family, finally they had a very healthy baby boy.</p> <p>You Ran-Mi's familiarity with the I-Ching's Eight Diagram, searching solutions to bring the baby with them, but he realized the baby will not live long, with the cause of fate, the results struck You Ran-Mi like a thunderbolt.</p> <p>This is the fate of robbers!</p> <p>Only the child came with us, he would have died!</p> <p>Even the husband and wife had the power of immortals, this made them understood, with the You Ran-Mi's speculation, they could not hide away this time.</p> <p>Teary eyes of a mother staring into her child, she knew the baby had a face like his mother, although he is still a baby but his face represent a very good looking appearance. It was hard to have a baby when at that period.</p> <p>The baby had fallen asleep, Mei-Luo carefully put her baby down to his cradle at the air, a gentle touch, she isolated all voices so the baby won't be disturbed.</p> <p>With the intelligence of You Ran-Mi, he could find a way out. </p> <p>You Ran-Mi at all cost will protect his family, his very own child, his very beloved wife, he would spare no effort.</p> <p>The husband and wife joined their hands, together calculating the lives of their child, she knew her husband had high intelligence, adding her wife that had reached Mahayana realm, the two could proceed with more power.</p> <p>Since the husband and wife can not live with their child, it was necessary for them to calculate the best location to escape from their fate of being robbers, no matter what, there is one point that the two agreed of, is that they can not raise their child.</p> <p>Mei-Luo always go hectic everytime her husband said this, she did not hate him, it was just difficult for her to did that to her child.</p> <p>At last Mei-Luo gave up on her hope, she decided to abandon her child, helping his husband, what should they do to let the child grow up.</p> <p>For this You Ran-Mi built an Eight Diagram Platform, he used the magical and spiritual powers, even consumed 8 spirits and 108 evil spirits to perform deduction.</p> <p>After the results of the deduction came out, the two were dumbfounded, with this result, the child must be in the clan of Yan world so the baby able to keep his lives, the husband and wife are the master of Mahayana realm that never showed their respect to the Yan world, they would not let their child to be in the Yan world. It is simply outrageous!</p> <br/> </div> <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script> <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;min-width:400px;max-width:970px;width:100%;height:90px" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5308237299920427" data-ad-slot="8439160794"></ins> <script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script> <hr> <style>.adbanner1{height:90px;width:100%}table.featuretable{border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:10px;-moz-border-radius:10px;padding:0}.featuretable td{text-align:center;border:0;width:50%}.featuretable td:first-child{border-right:1px solid #ddd}.dark-theme .featuretable{background:#333}#loadDisqusBtn{width:100%;height:50px;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:8px;-moz-border-radius:8px;text-align:center;background-color:buttonface;color:buttontext}.dark-theme #loadDisqusBtn{background:#484848;color:#ddd}</style> <table class="featuretable"> <tr> <td> <form action="https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify" method="post" target="popupwindow" onsubmit="window.open('https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=novellatranslation/eMQl', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=550,height=520');return true"> <p>Enter your email address:</p> <p><input type="text" style="width:140px" name="email"/></p> <input type="hidden" value="novellatranslation/eMQl" name="uri"/> <input type="hidden" name="loc" value="en_US"/> <input type="submit" value="Subscribe"/> <p>Delivered by <a href="https://feedburner.google.com" target="_blank">FeedBurner</a></p> </form> </td> <td> <form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top"> <input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick"> <input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="EVZ9HBHXCBNKE"> <p> Donate to <b>NovellaTranslation</b> </p> <input type="image" src="https://kadadi92.github.io/testpublic/donate.png" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal â€“ The safer, easier way to pay online!"> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1"> </form> </td> </tr> </table> <hr> <button id="loadDisqusBtn" style="cursor:pointer">Show Comments</button> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <br><br><br> <script>$(document).ready(function(){$("#loadDisqusBtn").on("click",function(){var t="novellatranslation-com-2";$.ajax({type:"GET",url:"http://"+t+".disqus.com/embed.js",dataType:"script",cache:!0}),$(this).fadeOut()})});</script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> </body> </html>
