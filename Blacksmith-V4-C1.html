A man swiftly opened the window of my room from the outside, as I was trying to start with my daily manual labours.<br/> <br/> "Prince!?"<br/> As I turned around and tried to catch up with what was going on, I looked clearly puzzled. I didn't care.<br/> In that moment I also realized that my room was exposed to enemy invasions at any time.<br/> <p>"What are you doing here?"<br/> "Well, well... I have a lot of things to do."<br/> "What things to do? You are a prince, you don't have to do anything at all."<br/> "Sorry... You are just an artisan, you don't know anything about noble families."<br/> "Could you leave me alone, please?"<br/> "Once you are done here, would you help me out?"<br/></p> <br/> The prince crouched down and caught sight with me.<br/> The atmosphere was surprisingly serious. For real.<br/> <br/> "What is it?"<br/> "In reality, I was looking for Iris right now."<br/> Oh, wow! I found a stalker. It was 9:31 am, and the prince was trying to get himself arrested.<br/> <br/> "What, what are you doing?"<br/> He grabbed my wrist and I shook off his hand.<br/> "No, I am just kidding."<br/> "Well... Kururi, if you could help me out..."<br/> I was busy, though.<br/> The prince assumed a more regal tone, and a new, selfish aspect of his personality transparred.<br/> Bothersome.<br/> <br/> But cooperating with him would have a positive impact on my future.<br/> The prize was worth the effort.<br/> <br/> "Ha, the unfaithful retinue will let the prince carry out his mission all on his own."<br/> <br/> "Why do you have to be so hostile?"<br/> Ho ho ho, I hit the nail on the head there.<br/> <br/> Why was he looking for Iris? Whatever his motives were, I was worried.<br/> What could have been going on?<br/> <br/> "Iris was in the room next to this one a couple of minutes ago, so I thought we could go and have a look."<br/> "No, you're being intrusive. Please stop it."<br/> "We don't have time."<br/> "No, you never have time, do you."<br/> <br/> <br/> I followed the prince, but I hoped that story would end shortly.<br/> <br/> "Iris is a very anxious person, don't forget that."<br/> "Bah! You do whatever you want! It's not like I care about Iris really!"<br/> That sounded quite childish.<br/> <br/> "What am I supposed to do exactly?"<br/> "Don't just stand there, you have to escort me, escort me."<br/> "Escort? Is that my job?"<br/> Escort of the prince, a duty worthy of a noble. I guess I would do it.<br/> <br/> "Recently, Iris has become quite worrysome, don't you think so?"<br/> "No."<br/> "Well, I'm not a woman, so I don't really know what is going on in her mind right now."<br/> <br/> "Iris has definitely been depressed recently, and if a friend of mine is sad, I feel like I have to do something about it... so we must find out what is going on, but we must not reveal ourselves."<br/> "You said that we were going to do it right now, right? Where are we headed?"<br/> "... If something happens to Iris, I'll never forgive myself."<br/> <br/> "You're forcing me to do this, remember that."<br/> <br/> Feeling silent anger, our stalking continued.<br/> <be/> Today, Iris only took classes in the morning.<br/> I looked at her sitting in her class, she seemed focused.<br/> <br/> There seemed to be nothing wrong there.<br/> "She's fine now, she's listening to the lesson."<br/> "So this has nothing to do with it?"<br/> <br/> <br/> After the lesson, Iris walked into the library.<br/> Apparently, we were about to find something out very soon.<br/> We were peeping through the bookshelves.<br/> <br/> "She seems ok, nothing looks wrong."<br/> "We're wasting our time, we won't find out anything today... wait." Someone approached her.<br/> <br/> <br/> As the prince pointed at them, three mysterious beautiful girls were approaching Iris.<br/> They all had brown, long hair.<br/> They looked nice at a first glance, but there was something strange in the way they walked and moved their hands.<br/> Their skin was bright, and looked very neat. They had well-shaped hips, and were not excessively skinny.<br/> I didn't think anything good was about to happen. No, not at all.<br/> <br/> The prince looked very worried.<br/> My face was pale.<br/> <br/> It was because they were smiling. Not as friends, there was malice in their faces.<br/> It didn't look good!<br/> <br/> Curse them! The prince was livid at those three girls!<br/> They were definitely about to harass Iris.<br/> I had never realized that before, but Iris was being harassed at school.<br/> <br/> They were doing it right there.<br/> The prince was about to jump out! Don't make anything stupid!<br/> <br/> They eventually reached her, but Iris didn't look worried. She was not really bothered by those petty things.<br/> I think she was much stronger than me.<br/> <br/> "Oh, sorry."<br/> <br/> One of the girls hurriedly hit Iris' chair.<br/> Iris' pen slipped, and drew a long line on her book.<br/> <br/> "I'm so sorry, can you forgive me?"<br/> "Well, you didn't do it on purpose, there is no problem."<br/> <br/> Iris answered with a smile. She showed confidence, and didn't look bothered by any of that.<br/> <br/> The girls left.<br/> <br/> That event left huge scars.<br/> Not on Iris though. She went back to studying as if nothing had really happened.<br/> Iris was not the type of person to lose her temper over something like that.<br/> <br/> Fortunately things had not escalated, and the incident had died out quickly.<br/> I was sure. Iris was not at all concerned.<br/> <br/> In regards to the prince... ah, a storm was gathering.<br/> <br/> The prince run after the three girls, who were walking away.<br/> Freeze!<br/> I hurried up and caught the prince's hand.<br/> <br/> "Let it go! Now you know what you wanted to, let it go!"<br/> "Not yet, I'm not done with those girls."<br/> "It's not necessary!"<br/> <br/> He kept on pulling until I could do nothing but let his hand go.<br/> "Okay, then do whatever you want. But that won't help Iris in any way."<br/> "... how can you say so?"<br/> "No, please, go and make a mess for nothing."<br/> "Ok, I won't do anything. But why is Iris feeling sad then?<br/> Somehow I looked a bit victorious.<br/> <br/> "Iris just doesn't mind it. She would rather have to work harder for her degree because she is discriminated as a commoner, so that everyone else will be impressed by her. That's how the world works."<br/> "Really?"<br/> "Yes, she must face her own troubles so that the prince will appreciate her more, that's how she feels."<br/> "... Ok, I think I understand. Their execution is suspended for now."<br/> <br/> I saw Iris kept on studying.<br/> What was the hardest part of this job?<br/> It required a lt of endurance.<br/> <br/> While Iris was eating in the school garden, we took the chance to have lunch ourselves.<br/> We both ate sandwiches.<br/> Mine had plenty of sauce.<br/> The prince had a vegetables sandwich. Raw vegetables, from what I could see.<br/> <br/> "Hey, I like that one as well."<br/> "Please, have a morsel."<br/> I let him do as he pleased. It is irresistible to be harassed by power.<br/> Iris ended her lunch and looked happy.<br/> There was nothing wrong at that moment, apparently.<br/> Still, the prince was mumbling.<br/> <br/> Well, I had other plans in mind, but was the prince really going to follow Iris for 24 hours straight?<br/> It was about time we talked about something important.<br/> <br/> "Prince: why do you think people reward other people?"<br/> "There are several possible reasons. Maybe if you like a certain person, and that person feels happy for the reward, then you feel rewarded as well."<br/> "What will I get for helping you?"<br/> "We'll get this sorted out after Iris' issue will have been dealt with."<br/> Well done, peasant. That seemed to work!<br/> <br/> I had never owned anything of value.<br/> That was fine. Even if your house collapses, a merchant will still have precious items for sale, so they won't ever get lost. It was some kind of long-term investment.<br/> I really wanted something valuable though. This time I was actually expecting something in return.<br/> But in order to achieve that, we still had to fix Iris' issue.<br/> <br/> <p>"Iris is going."<br/> "Okay, let's move."<br/> Our suspicious stalking mission was not over yet.</p> <h4>Note: If you want to support this translation, but canâ€™t donate, consider adding us to your ad blockerâ€™s whitelist.
